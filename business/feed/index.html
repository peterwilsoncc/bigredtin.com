In the past I&#8217;ve literally spent days (if not weeks) looking for a good project tracking tool, or a group collaboration tool.</p><p>I&#8217;ve played with <a
href="http://lifehacker.com/5604687/google-halts-wave-development-shutting-it-down-by-end-of-year" title="Google Halts Wave Development, Shutting It Down By End of Year">Google Wave</a> (<abbr
title="Of Blessed Memory">OBM</abbr>) and toyed with <a
href="http://pbworks.com/" title="PBworks: Online Collaboration">PBWorks</a>. I tried wikis and intranets, I implemented networks and created complicated Excel spreadsheets. I have used at least five different time trackers and even more wireframing tools.</p><p>None of those things ever helped get the work completed quicker, more efficiently or better in any way.</p><p>I have largely learnt my lesson from this and mostly stick to the processes I know.</p><p>So, when a client recently asked me to create a software solution to a clearly inefficient business process I panicked and told them the first idea that came to mind. That idea was a complicated online spreadsheet and I am yet to implement it because I fear it&#8217;s just another distraction.</p><p>I&#8217;ve never found anything in web technologies as efficient or simple for managing workflow as a well-planned whiteboard.</p><p>My favourite whiteboard is the one in<cite><a
href="http://www.tv.com/show/110/summary.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street on TV.com">Homicide: Life on the Streets</a></cite>. It sits up on the wall in the homicide office and features the names of the detectives and the cases they&#8217;re working on. An unsolved case is written in red marker and when it is solved it&#8217;s rewritten in black.</p><p>Red and black. That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s easy to look at the board and instantly see where everything is up to.</p><p>There are, however, two problems with a whiteboard:<br
/> 1) It is, to an extent, transient. There&#8217;s no permanent or historical record to refer to.<br
/> 2) There is no way for people to refer to it remotely. People might need to access the information while &#8220;on-site&#8221;.</p><p>These problems/requirements complicate the issue. It&#8217;s quite easy to have an elegantly simple solution to a simple problem but this is not a simple problem.</p><p>It&#8217;s a problem that many businesses face. The person who started the business has a lot of information in her head. She has also tracked jobs and written notes in a series of notebooks. It made perfect sense to her when the business was just her and her business partner but then her business grew. Over time more and more people needed to access that information.</p><p>I&#8217;ve worked for people who would ponder on a problem for a frustratingly long time. They would sit and reject idea after idea until they ran out of time to act. I&#8217;m often the opposite and I&#8217;ll jump on a solution, try it and then discard it a while later. Neither is good for business.</p><p>What I keep forgetting, though, is that the excellent whiteboard in <em>Homicide</em> probably wasn&#8217;t the first system they tried in that office filled with detectives. There must have been a time when the Baltimore police department didn&#8217;t have an elegantly simple solution for keeping score of investigations.</p><p>The key is to ask at every step, &#8220;Is this leading to a simpler way?&#8221; My client&#8217;s problem started as a simple process and was complicated over time. My job is <em>not</em> to make it more complicated.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/simplifying-can-complicate-things/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Why we host Big Red Tin on US servers</title><link>/business/why-we-host-on-american-servers/</link> <comments>/business/why-we-host-on-american-servers/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2010 20:00:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[boxcutters]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Linode]]></category> <category><![CDATA[QuadraHosting]]></category> <category><![CDATA[web hosting]]></category><guid

Soon after I relocated the Soupgiant sites to an American service provider. Situations change and so I thought I'd explain why.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, I wrote a post in which I stated I&#8217;d be sticking with Australian web hosting provider <a
title="Quadra Hosting" href="/business/get-4-3-stars-for-customer-service/">Quadra Hosting</a>. Shortly after writing that post I&#8217;d relocated the Soupgiant sites to an American service provider.</p><p>Even though I&#8217;ve <a
title="done similar" href="/behind-the-websites/base-js-file/">done similar</a> <a
title="before" href="/behind-the-websites/partying-like-its-1999/">before</a>, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a compulsive liar. I promise. It&#8217;s because situations change and they can change quickly.</p><p>About the time we switched hosting providers, Soupgiant became responsible for hosting the <a
title="Boxcutters" href="http://boxcutters.net">Boxcutters</a> podcast. Each week Boxcutters releases an MP3 between 35 and 45 MB which is, in turn, downloaded at least 1000 times.</p><p>The maths is pretty simple, each week Boxcutters, alone, uses 35 GB or more of bandwidth. With our current host, <a
title="Linode" href="http://www.linode.com/?r=dbabace8cfcb30b5af6f5cbadfc5a628c2b6ae35">Linode</a>, we&#8217;re paying a little under $US60 for a VPS and 600 GB of bandwidth. To get the equivalent bandwidth in Australia, we would be charged at least ten times that amount.</p><p>(Yes, that&#8217;s an affiliate link. If you&#8217;d rather not follow an affiliate link, use this link to <a
title="Linode" href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>.)</p><p>It&#8217;s not entirely the fault of Australian hosts that they&#8217;re pricing themselves out of an international market. According to the OECD, retail bandwidth in Australia is <a
title="50% more expensive (link to spreadsheet)" href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/22/45/39575011.xls">50% more expensive</a> than in the US. It&#8217;s safe to conclude this is a reflection of wholesale pricing.</p><p>To state the obvious, hosting pricing has to follow the lead of bandwidth pricing. So if Australian web hosting providers are gouged, gouging of their customer must follow.</p><p>I&#8217;d love to host the Soupgiant websites in Australia, partly due to home-town pride but mostly because the 25,000 km (15,500 mi) round trip to California is pointless.</p><p>The simple fact is: Soupgiant can&#8217;t afford to host our sites locally, given that most of the bandwidth is used for a loss-making podcast.</p><p>Hosting the sites in the USA means we may break even some months but locally there&#8217;s no chance.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/why-we-host-on-american-servers/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Networking is the New Networking</title><link>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/</link> <comments>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2010 20:42:44 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[exposure]]></category> <category><![CDATA[marketing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[networking]]></category> <category><![CDATA[selling]]></category><guid

href="http://www.aussiecon4.org.au/" title="AussieCon4 :: Home">AussieCon 4</a>, which is what <a
href="http://www.worldcon.org/" title="World Science Fiction Society / Worldcon [Official]">WorldCon</a> is called when it&#8217;s in Australia. WorldCon, for the uninitiated, is the World Science Fiction Convention. An annual event held at a different location somewhere in the world.</p><p>I was there in my capacity as one of the hosts of <a
href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">Boxcutters</a>. We were presenting and recording a panel. It was wonderful to meet a lot of people who already enjoyed the podcast and those who seemed interested in downloading it.</p><p>Actually, it was just wonderful to meet a lot of people.</p><p>My experience at <a
href="http://sxsw.com/" title="SXSW.com">SxSW</a> earlier this year was similar.</p><p>These conventions are not just about learning things. In fact, and let&#8217;s be honest here, they&#8217;re not really about learning things in panel sessions. They&#8217;re about being around like-minded people who might be interested in what you do and vice-versa. They&#8217;re about meeting people.</p><p>I went to a few &#8220;networking&#8221; evenings arranged by various &#8220;small business&#8221; groups back when I ran my first business a few years ago. There was too much pressure on those nights. People would be busy sussing other people out, swapping business cards and big-noting themselves. It felt really sleazy and desperate.</p><p>Networking is not about desperation. It&#8217;s just about meeting people. Some of them will be useful to you, some of them will find you useful, some will become actual friends and others will be forgotten.</p><p>The point is, though, that actual physical exposure is what is important. These are people who would not have heard of you if you hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>As a result of my time at AussieCon and SxSW, a lot more people have heard about Boxcutters and Soupgiant. In turn, I&#8217;ve been exposed to some podcasts, blogs and services myself that would never have come into my radar if I hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>It&#8217;s that simple point of mutual exposure that makes going to conferences and conventions worthwhile.</p><p>Also sometimes the parties can be really good.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>An Answer to the Twitter Question</title><link>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/</link> <comments>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2010 06:45:40 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[advertising]]></category> <category><![CDATA[buzz]]></category> <category><![CDATA[promotion]]></category> <category><![CDATA[publicity]]></category> <category><![CDATA[social networks]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Twitter]]></category> <category><![CDATA[zeitgeist]]></category><guid

After a couple of years of thinking about an answer, Josh might finally have one.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions we&#8217;re often asked by clients when doing an initial consultation is &#8220;what about twitter?&#8221; It goes along with &#8220;should we have a Facebook page?&#8221; and &#8220;how do I get MySpace friends?&#8221;</p><p>Social networking, of the web-based variety, is something that people will be writing books about for years to come. It&#8217;s as hot now as it was 3 years ago and 5 years ago. That is to say, it continues to be hot because there continue to be new social networks that become popular and die out and then become popular and then die out again.</p><p>The trick for a business is to be able to appropriately surf that wave of social network highs and lows and never put all eggs into a single basket.</p><p>There are big businesses that do great work on Twitter. Airlines like <a
href="http://twitter.com/virginblue">Virgin Blue</a> and <a
href="http://twitter.com/southwestair">Southwest</a> have a team dedicated to monitoring social websites to see what people are saying about them. So do telecommunications companies like <a
href="http://twitter.com/optus">Optus</a>.</p><p>For customers the advantage is that they can have a direct line to vent their frustrations. Shout out on Twitter about how outrageously incorrect your bill seems to be and you can not only have friends console you or also share their experiences, but there&#8217;s a fairly good chance someone from the company will be in touch to help you through your issue.</p><p>For companies the advantage is largely and expectedly the reverse. It&#8217;s easy to monitor exactly what people are saying about your company, your industry or your competitors. It&#8217;s also really easy to reach out to a customer and make them feel a little bit special by personally helping them with their problem.</p><p>Twitter, however, is not the place to try to influence customers or get them to change their habits. It is not as effective as an advertising campaign or a media release but it is a good place to see what people are saying about your latest ad campaign etc. Twitter for companies is more about measurement and accessibility than direct marketing and that&#8217;s important to remember.</p><p>Nobody likes to be spammed at. Nobody needs to get a direct message because they followed your company. People don&#8217;t hang around with Twitter because they enjoy being bombarded with irrelevant messages. They use the service because it helps them feel connected and part of a community. That&#8217;s important to remember because, while it might be hard to build up a good reputation on Twitter, it will only take minutes to be burnt and razed to the ground with no one around to sweep up your ashes.</p><p>A <a
href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tb/tb100809comic-con_and_hollyw">recent radio piece about Comic-Con</a> featured a genre film promoter talking about changing people&#8217;s opinions and excitement about a product. He told a story about going to Comic-Con to convince an audience of die-hard <em>Batman</em> fans that the, then, new movie (1989) would not be the camp 1960s <em>Batman</em> despite the involvement of the director of a <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/">Pee-Wee Herman film</a> and the guy from <em><a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085970/">Mr Mom</a></em>. Within minutes he managed to turn the audience from a booing mass to applauding fans excited with anticipation.</p><p>An opinion turn-around like that could never be achieved on Twitter. The value Twitter has, though, is that if something like that were to happen today, the people in that room would tweet about it and excitement about the product would spread exponentially and almost instantly</p><p>Twitter is the buzz. If our clients are on Twitter they are in a much better position to have their finger on the pulse and give them more information about the zeitgeist. They might not have a million followers but at the very least they&#8217;ll be able to gauge influence.</p><p>Twitter gives companies the ability to do something they&#8217;ve never done before. They have a direct link into their customers&#8217; thoughts and conversations. That&#8217;s a very powerful tool and it needs to be approached with patience and a lot of thought.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Reply to Emails to Manage Expectations</title><link>/business/reply-to-emails-to-manage-expectations/</link> <comments>/business/reply-to-emails-to-manage-expectations/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2010 23:15:50 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[communication]]></category> <category><![CDATA[email]]></category> <category><![CDATA[inbox zero]]></category> <category><![CDATA[information-management]]></category> <category><![CDATA[time-management]]></category><guid

In contrast, not replying to email can be detrimental to your reputation and your relationships. It's your choice.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many great blog posts about managing your email. Most of them are by <a
href="http://inboxzero.com/inboxzero/">Merlin Mann with his Inbox Zero philosophy</a> which will soon be available in book form. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with it, I recommend checking it out and especially taking the time to <a
href="http://inboxzero.com/video/">watch the one hour video</a>.</p><p>The nature of email, of course, is communication.</p><p>I&#8217;ve worked with people who might have scanned the subject lines for something interesting but I could never rely on them having read an email I sent. Their inboxes became a communication void.</p><p>If I wanted them to read an email I had to send them an instant message or SMS to tell them I sent an email I wanted them to read. Other times I&#8217;d send the email and then print it out and put it on their desk. It was not a very efficient way to communicate.</p><p>It might take anywhere between 30-60 seconds to reply to an email.</p><p>Sometimes the reply might only require &#8220;Thanks&#8221; and then it takes even less time.</p><p>As part of my work with <a
href="http://boxcutters.net">Boxcutters</a> I often have a need to email US-based television publicists. It&#8217;s becoming an increasingly futile exercise. They never reply. I may as well shout my requests across the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>If they can&#8217;t help me, then I&#8217;d at least like a simple:<br
/><blockquote> I&#8217;m sorry but we don&#8217;t deal with [Australians / Podcasts / People we've never heard of].</p></blockquote><p> Or even the generic:<br
/><blockquote>We can&#8217;t assist you with your request at this time.</p></blockquote><p>An email that requires a lot of attention could be acknowledged really quickly with something like:<br
/><blockquote>Thanks, I&#8217;ve flagged this to read later and I&#8217;ll let you know my thoughts within a week.</p></blockquote><p> That says a lot. It says: &#8220;I know you&#8217;re telling me something you think is important but please understand that I&#8217;m busy and I can&#8217;t give it my full attention right now. I will read it and let you know what I think in my own time.&#8221;</p><p>This is called managing expectations in email. Email doesn&#8217;t need an instant response. A lot of email only needs a response at some stage that day. Some needs a response at some stage that week. Some doesn&#8217;t need any response at all.</p><p>You need to work out your own criteria for prioritising email but be one hundred percent sure that if someone  has taken the time to write to you personally, they are hoping for some kind of reply or acknowledgement that you are paying attention.</p><p>Similarly, if you&#8217;re sending an email, maybe include a line about how soon you need a reply. It will help the other person formulate their response. And please, if something is really urgent, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone">use the telephone</a>.</p><p>Replying to email doesn&#8217;t take very long, doesn&#8217;t cost much but works wonders to strengthen relationships.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/reply-to-emails-to-manage-expectations/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Business is not like Sport</title><link>/business/business-is-not-like-sport/</link> <comments>/business/business-is-not-like-sport/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2010 00:30:10 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[37 Signals]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Analogies]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Jason Calacanis]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Jeffrey Zeldman]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Leo Laporte]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Molly Holzschlag]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Risk]]></category><guid

Watching World Cup soccer and playing baseball, as I do, the similarities between doing well in sports and business seem obvious. In fact, since Robert DeNiro, playing Al Capone in <em>The Untouchables</em> bashed in an associate's head while making a baseball analogy, drawing lines of comparison between the two has become clich&#233;.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A kid who wants to play golf looks up to Tiger Woods and not Derek Jeter. That makes sense but in business we use sports analogies when we should use business analogies.</p><p>More importantly, in business we need to see what other people have done to learn from their mistakes and successes.</p><p>At Soupgiant we call ourselves Web Producers. We produce the Web. So I try to look for people who have successes in that field. People like Jason Calacanis and Leo Laporte have built success for themselves out of the web.</p><p>They could be compared to sporting greats like Tiger Woods and Derek Jeter. They never gave up, they tried to overcome their obstacles and they worked damn hard to become who they are. But there are more differences than similarities.</p><p>The difference in business is the risks we take. It can take between five and ten years to know if a business is ever going to be successful. In sport the wins and losses are almost instantaneous by comparison.</p><p>In business you have to sit with a decision for years before you see fruit. It could be years in which there is very little income. It&#8217;s also years in which you could be earning more money elsewhere.</p><p>It&#8217;s all about context. There&#8217;s no point in trying to be the <a
href="http://www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/5628.html">Ian Healy</a> of the Web. He was a cricketer <strong>and there is no comparison</strong>.</p><p>Everybody who succeeds in their area works hard. The people who succeed in our area work hard doing what we do.</p><p>It&#8217;s time we started sharing our own stories, our own opinions and our discussions of the risks we take. We can learn from each other in our own areas by making comparisons that actually make sense.</p><p>So we have this blog. <a
href="http://www.twitter.com/jason">Jason Calacanis</a> has<a
href="https://my.binhost.com/lists/listinfo/jason"> a mailing list </a>that is worth subscribing to (even if he does make too many sports analogies). Leo Laporte has the <a
href="http://twit.tv/">TWiT network of Podcasts</a>. 37 Signals has the <a
href="http://37signals.com/svn">Signal vs Noise blog</a> and two books. Molly Holzschlag has <a
href="http://molly.com/">her (rarely updated) blog</a> and many books. Jeffrey Zeldman has <a
href="http://www.zeldman.com/">a blog</a>, <a
href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow">a video podcast</a> and many books.</p><p>Those are some of the people we look to for advice, examples, inspiration and experience.

As it turned out, we were unable to help with the task they had in mind. It was outside our area of expertise.</p><p>We may have been able to fudge it. Call us stupid, but we don&#8217;t think &#8216;fudging it&#8217; is the way to keep clients happy or maintain a low client turnover.</p><p>In this situation there are two options:</p><ol><li>Quote ludicrously high with the aim of missing out on the job. In the event the quote is accepted, the job can be outsourced with a tidy profit.</li><li>Tell the truth and decline the work</li></ol><p>We chose the latter option and used the opportunity to explain our areas of expertise.

We talked about this while she dug her elbows into my forearm, persuading me to swap my mouse to my other hand.</p><p>My instant response, whenever somebody starts a conversation like this is to ask them why they want a website. At least that&#8217;s what it used to be. Apparently it&#8217;s bad business to tell people they don&#8217;t need what it is you&#8217;re selling. I held off for as long as I could. The conversation went something like this:</p><p>&#8220;How much would you charge for a basic website?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;For a website with original graphic design using a content management system you&#8217;re looking at a minimum of a few thousand dollars. It varies depending on what functionality you want on the site.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;OK. I called up this place that advertises on the radio. You know, &#8216;quick and simple websites from $495&#8242;?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve heard the ad.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;Well, it got really weird. They kept calling me and now they keep emailing me. I don&#8217;t really want to use them now. They&#8217;re too much like stalkers.&#8221;</p><p>We&#8217;ve all heard about how, when something sounds like too much of a bargain to be true, it probably is. This was definitely the case with &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243;. It turned out that for $495 you could have 3 pages. Extra pages cost more money and then there were the ongoing costs of hosting, a monthly cost of licensing their <abbr
title="content management system">CMS</abbr> and who knows what other hidden costs.</p><p>Let&#8217;s go back one step. They were charging <em>per page</em>. I remember people charging per page back in 1997, when sites were static. In fact, charging per page implies that they&#8217;re not using a CMS. So why then are they charging for CMS licensing?</p><p>So I told her what I thought she needed. She&#8217;s a physiotherapist and her business relies on her expertise in the area. A blog about physiotherapy, new techniques, stretching the right way, and avoiding injury could really help build her profile as an expert in the area.</p><p>&#8220;But a blog is a lot of work,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Not keeping it up-to-date can do as much damage to your reputation as maintaining the blog will improve it.&#8221;</p><p>She already works long hours and I knew she didn&#8217;t want <em>more</em> work. So finally I asked her what she thinks she can get from a website. I pointed out to her that her business is already at capacity. Not a single slot is left vacant all week.</p><p>It turns out that an organisation for a new technique she&#8217;s been accredited with wants to put a link to her website on their website. That&#8217;s all. In fact, that&#8217;s enough. The website could help her expand her business using this new technique.</p><p>It reminded me why I ask the question of potentially new clients. It means we&#8217;re going to build the right website for them <em>if they actually need something built</em>. If a client actually has a need for a new website then we can work towards that need. It helps us advise them on content, style and structure. These are all services that &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243; won&#8217;t provide.</p><p>The problem, though, is that businesses like those that advertise web production services at prices that seem too good to be true create an expectation in the market-place. They prey on those who don&#8217;t know enough about what they&#8217;re purchasing, lock them into systems where they end up paying more over time without ever actually giving them value for money.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Thinking: More Important Than Ideas</title><link>/business/thinking-more-important-than-ideas/</link> <comments>/business/thinking-more-important-than-ideas/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2010 06:33:38 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><guid

Ideas are best blurted out and, subsequently, best thought over.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ideas are useless. There. I said it. It&#8217;s one of the big reasons <a
href="http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html">you can&#8217;t copyright an idea</a>. Ideas on their own are nothing, fleeting and piffle.</p><p>Thinking, on the other hand, can lead to something. Ideas come out of nowhere. We can&#8217;t hold onto them. We shouldn&#8217;t even try. Ideas are best blurted out and, subsequently, best thought over.</p><p>I can&#8217;t count the number of times I&#8217;ve heard people talk about brainstorming and still it&#8217;s such a rarity in the business world. I can think of a few reasons why:</p><ol><li>&#8220;Brainstorming&#8221; is a terrible word. It sounds like an activity one might do at a corporate retreat. Writers call it &#8220;workshopping&#8221; which is almost as bad but feels a little more consultative and inclusive.</li><li>Thinking is hard.</li><li>People are scared that maybe their ideas are no good. Further investigation might prove that their idea is bad and that could lead to a blow to self-esteem.</li></ol><p>I&#8217;m guilty of this. I&#8217;ve sat in meetings and not wanted to speak up in case my idea was no good. I&#8217;ve also sat in meetings when other people have had ideas and responded internally or sometimes (and shamefully) orally that the idea was no good.</p><p>This is horribly destructive behaviour. Nothing good comes of rejecting an idea outright. The truth is that ideas are not useless. I lied. Ideas have one very important use. They are starting points.</p><p>I remember one meeting in which I was presented with an exceptionally startling idea. It involved completely abandoning all the work that came before and changing direction. &#8220;Let&#8217;s completely abandon all the work that we&#8217;ve done and focus on this other thing,&#8221; was actually the starting point of the meeting. It&#8217;s a terrifying prospect.</p><p>It&#8217;s terrifying because, apart from being precious about all the work already done, this idea might lead us down the wrong path. &#8220;Might&#8221; is an important word here because wherever there&#8217;s a &#8220;might&#8221; there is similarly a &#8220;might not&#8221;. Both paths need to be embraced when presented with an idea.</p><p>So we started doing something nobody else discussing the idea had done. We started investigating it. We drew sketches on bits of paper. We asked each other questions, answered them and made notes. We thought about ways we could make something that worked.</p><p>We all fought that instinct that causes us to say &#8220;no&#8221; instantly. Instead we asked more questions. &#8220;No&#8221; doesn&#8217;t get you anywhere but questions about potential problems can lead to solutions.</p><p>What we ended up with was a long way from the original idea. Instead, it was a set of building blocks on which to plan something new and potentially wonderful. At the end of it we all felt pretty positive about the work we had done.</p><p>Our final concept might never come to fruition but the client now has enough information to make a decision. That&#8217;s all they really wanted, and all we had to do was think about it.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/thinking-more-important-than-ideas/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Confirming a caller&#8217;s identity</title><link>/business/confirming-a-callers-identity/</link> <comments>/business/confirming-a-callers-identity/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 21 Dec 2009 00:23:10 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[ato]]></category> <category><![CDATA[phishing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[security]]></category><guid

href="http://ato.gov.au/">ATO</a> called me last week and asked for my middle name and date of birth to confirm my identity. I told the operator that I wasn?t in the habit of giving out my personal details to incoming callers.</p><p>Rather than try to convince me that anyone could answer my mobile phone, the operator agreed it would be foolish to give out such details. He gave me his extension number, and a phone number where I could verify he was from the tax office.</p><p>Being the cynical sort, or paranoid (I&#8217;ll let you decide), I googled the ATO&#8217;s website to confirm the number. It was legitimate. I called back and reconnected to the operator immediately. The entire process took less than 30 seconds.</p><p>It got me thinking: Googling &#8216;&lt;number&gt; site:ato.gov.au&#8217; in hope the ATO had slipped up and the non-public number was on their website was an inefficient step.</p><p>A more efficient way to confirm the number would be for the operator to give out an ATO URL: <code>ato.gov.au/&lt;number&gt;</code> being the logical choice. At the URL, there could be a short message informing the visitor that the number is an ATO phone number. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">Robots.txt</a> would be used to exclude search engines from indexing that URL.</p><p>It&#8217;s a simple fix that costs the ATO very little and protects them and their tax payers.</p><p>I was running this idea past fellow giant <a
title="Josh Kinal" href="/author/josh">Josh</a>, and he put forward a problem with my solution. Rather than spoil the fun, I&#8217;ll let Josh put forward his side of the story at a later date.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/confirming-a-callers-identity/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
