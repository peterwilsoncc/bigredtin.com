features when doing so is progressive enhancement, but I agree that
it shouldn&#039;t be used to make the site readable and usable. Keep in
mind that 2% of Yahoo&#039;s visitors is probably millions of people, or
at least in the upper hundreds of thousands.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m fine with using JavaScript to emulate HTML5 and CSS3<br

HTML5 elements rendering a page unusable to IE users with JS turned
off, even if they are paranoid fringe case users of a crappy
browser. :) My plan is to wrap the fall-back divs in conditional
comments, use Modernizr, and add selectors for the fall-back divs
descended from the .no-js class to the same styles that _should_ be
applied to the HTML5 elements.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for this. I too struggle with the idea of unstyled<br

isPermaLink="false">/?p=967#comment-1952</guid> <description>Hmm is 2% really worth supporting then? I do understand what you mean about Google&#039;s API going down, even though that happens more rarely then the possibility of your entire server going down.I guess it would depend on your site and target audience and whether or not that downtime would seriously hurt anything.As for the  issue, why not have cleaner code by doing what A Book Apart suggests in HTML5 for Web Designers and just IDing your divs with the new HTML tags? For example:&lt;code&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
Half of those we all probably used before HTML5 was thought of :)</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hmm is 2% really worth supporting then?

know how to turn off js or CSS? Most don&#039;t even know that there are
other browsers than IE. The only people who turn off js know
they&#039;re doing so, are most likely developers or advanced users, and
are handicapping their online experiences. There&#039;s going to have to
be a line of where we stop support for random cases, otherwise your
work will never be finishable.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the chance that an average web user is going to<br
