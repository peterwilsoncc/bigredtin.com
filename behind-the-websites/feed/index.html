For the JavaScript impaired the sites may be missing a minor visual feature or be a little clunky in places, but they work and the meaning remains clear. It doesn&#8217;t bother me that, sometimes, the cost of allowing for sites to load without JavaScript can mean missing out on the latest web fashion. I&#8217;m <a
title="Why I will not be dropping support for IE6" href="/behind-the-websites/not-dropping-ie6/">not a big fan of fashion</a>.</p><p>Currently, web development is undergoing some major transitions: the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> spec is being developed and <abbr>CSS3</abbr> is being implemented. The browser wars have returned, although this time around, it&#8217;s a battle to win developers&#8217; hearts by implementing the newest standards.</p><p>Now is the time for developers to re-evaluate their past practices; moving on from the old and embracing the new. I kept that ethos in mind when upgrading the Soupgiant WordPress base theme recently. Among other things we were porting it to <abbr>HTML5</abbr>.</p><p><span
id="more-967"></span></p><p>I really tried to adopt the commonly advocated view that it&#8217;s okay to require website visitors have JavaScript enabled. It was going very well, right up to the final hurdle when I couldn&#8217;t resist checking the site I was working on without JavaScript.</p><p>Everything looked fine in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. It was, predictably, Internet Explorer that threw a spanner in the works. For an artist&#8217;s impression, <a

I didn&#8217;t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, the additional meaning provided by <abbr>HTML5</abbr> elements is just too great. <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc all provide meaning to a document that it&#8217;s difficult to justify going without.</p><p>It&#8217;s with the additional meaning in mind that I decided to go with &#8211; what I&#8217;ve dubbed &#8211; <abbr>HTML4.5</abbr>. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> provides the meaning while using traditional <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 tags as hooks for styling. It introduces a bit of tag soup, as instead of <code>&lt;article id="content"&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;</code> the code becomes <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;article&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p><p>The improvement to site I was working on was immediate, as you can see by <a

I save plenty more than 40 bytes by minimising my JavaScript and <abbr>CSS</abbr> (a single key combo with the <a

I believe this to be incorrect.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Respecting someone or their publication does not prevent one from disagreeing with them. In fact, I think to nod along saying &#8220;you&#8217;re so right, <em>OMG, you are so right!</em>&#8221; is less respectful than listening to and considering what they say. That dealt with, allow me to disagree with some people I respect.</p><p>Frequently, I see HTML forms coded as lists. I&#8217;ve seen this in code by some publications and people I highly respect, such as on <a
title="A List Apart: Forward thinking form validation" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/forward-thinking-form-validation/">A List Apart</a>. The code may be:</p><pre><code>&lt;form action="example.php" method="post"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for="itemOne"&gt;Item One&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="itemOne" name="itemOne" /&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for="itemTwo"&gt;Item Two&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="itemTwo" name="itemTwo" /&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre><p><span
id="more-908"></span></p><p>The method remains much the same if using unordered or definition lists. The argument for using this method is that forms are a list of fields. A variation is to use a table, arguing that forms are a table of labels and inputs.</p><p>I don&#8217;t believe either argument is correct, I believe forms are a series of:</p><ul><li><code>fieldset</code>s;</li><li><code>legend</code>s;</li><li><code>label</code>s;</li><li><code>button</code>s;</li><li><code>input</code>s, <code>select</code>s, <code>option</code>s, etc.</li></ul><p>All semantic meaning for forms should come from the appropriate <abbr>HTML</abbr> tags. If you want to use other elements as hooks for styling, they should be semantically meaningless <code>span</code>s and <code>div</code>s.</p><p>I consider the arguments cited above as justifications for making styling easier. Without block elements, forms <em>can</em> be difficult to style. Rather than wrapping each input pair with a list item, I wrap them with <code>div</code>s.</p><pre><code>&lt;form action="example.php" method="post"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;label for="itemOne"&gt;Item One&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="itemOne" name="itemOne" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre><p>Wrapping each input pair in a <code>div</code> is just as lazy as wrapping each input pair in a list item. However, as <code>div</code>s are meaningless, it doesn&#8217;t require bending of semantics to justify my actions.</p><p>There is a valid argument for an element to define an input pair but I think such an element is redundant. We already have a method for defining the pairing of labels with their inputs. The &#8220;<code>for</code>&#8221; attribute within the <code>label</code> pairs with the &#8220;<code>id</code>&#8221; attribute of the associated <code>input</code>.</p><p>If you wrap your forms in a list or a table, look carefully at what you are doing. Ask yourself; is what you are doing semantically valid or are you lazily trying to make styling easier? As context for your consideration, ask yourself if a whole page of text is really just a list of paragraphs.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/forms-are-forms-not-lists/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Selectivizr with CSS on a sub-domain</title><link>/behind-the-websites/selectivizr-with-css-on-a-cdn/</link> <comments>/behind-the-websites/selectivizr-with-css-on-a-cdn/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2010 17:29:10 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Behind the Websites]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CDN]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CSS]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CSS3]]></category> <category><![CDATA[html5]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Selectivizr]]></category> <category><![CDATA[selectors]]></category><guid

To quote their site:</p><blockquote><p>Style sheets MUST be hosted on the same domain as the page due to browser security restrictions. Likewise,  style sheets loaded using the <code>file:</code> protocol will not work.</p></blockquote><p>Normally, particularly for low traffic sites, this wouldn&#8217;t be of great concern. As we share style sheets across sites (both Big Red Tin &amp; <a

title="Spritebaker" href="http://www.spritebaker.com/">Spritebaker</a> has been doing the rounds a fair bit in web development circles over the past few weeks, for the simple reason that it&#8217;s a great idea, done well. The best desciption comes from the site itself:</p><blockquote><p>It parses your css and returns a copy with all external media “baked” right into it as Base64 encoded datasets. The number of time consuming http-requests on your website is decreased significantly, resulting in a massive speed-boost.</p></blockquote><p>While baking images into your CSS to lower HTTP requests reduces the rendering time of your site overall, the downside is that CSS files <a
title="block the initial rendering" href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/rendering.html#PutCSSInHead">block the initial rendering</a> of your site. While an unbaked site may render and be built up as external images load, a baked site will not render until both the CSS and baked images have loaded. This has the strange effect of making it seem like the page is actually taking <em>longer</em> to load.</p><p>I&#8217;ve thrown together a quick example of an <a
title="unbaked page" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/unbaked.html">unbaked page</a> and its <a
title="baked equivalent" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/baked.html">baked equivalent</a>. In this example, the unbaked page begins rendering earlier than its baked counterpart but finishes later.</p><p>In an attempt to kick off rendering earlier, I tried what I&#8217;ve named a half-baked idea: splitting the <em>standard</em> CSS into one file and the baked images into another. My hope was that browsers would render the standard CSS while the other was still loading. As you can see on the <a
title="example page" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/halfbaked.html">example page</a>,  this failed.</p><p>With CSS only solutions delaying rendering of the page, it&#8217;s time to pull JavaScript out of our toolbox. Anyone whose read my article on <a
title="delaying loading of print CSS" href="/behind-the-websites/delay-loading-of-print-css/">delaying loading of print CSS</a> will find the solution eerily familiar. The CSS files are still split into the standard files and the file containing the baked-in images, the one with the baked in images is wrapped in &lt;noscript&gt; tags in the HTML head.</p><pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="halfbaked-1.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="jshalfbaked-2.css" type="text/css" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;</code></pre><p>This prevents the second/baked stylesheet from loading during the initial rendering of the page. Without this file blocking rendering, <a
title="this version of the example" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/jsbaked.html">this version of the example</a> begins rendering as quickly as the first, unbaked, example.</p><p>The second/baked stylesheet needs to be added using the JavaScript below:</p><pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
window.onload = function(){
  var cssNode = document.createElement('link');
  cssNode.type = 'text/css';
  cssNode.rel = 'stylesheet';
  cssNode.href = 'jshalfbaked-2.css';
  cssNode.media = 'all';
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(cssNode);
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><p>Using the method above for baking images into your CSS will give you the best of both worlds, your page will render quickly with a basic structure before a single HTTP request is used to load all of your images.</p><p>I used <a
title="Web Page Test" href="http://www.webpagetest.org">Web Page Test</a> to measure the first-run load times using IE9 Beta, averaged over 10 tests. On the test pages, with only a few images, the advantage of a baked stylesheet isn&#8217;t apparent, on a site with more images it would quickly become so.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Version</th><th>Starts Render</th><th>Fully Loaded</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a
title="Unbaked" href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/100919_5CCK/">Unbaked</a></td><td>0.490s</td><td>1.652s</td></tr><tr><td><a

title="Spritebaker Info page" href="http://www.spritebaker.com/info">Spritebaker info page</a> says, IE versions prior to IE8 don&#8217;t understand data-URIs, so you&#8217;ll need to use a generous sprinkling of conditional comments to load images the old fashioned way in these browsers.</p><p>The examples above were tested on IE9 Beta, Chrome 6.0, Safari 5.0, Opera 10.10 and Firefox 3.6.9. Individual results may vary.</p><p>We&#8217;d love to hear of your experiences with baking stylesheets, or other techniques you use to speed up apparent rendering of your page, especially if it slows the total load/rendering time.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/a-half-baked-css-idea/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>1</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>jQuery 1.5 as jQuery 1.5.0</title><link>/behind-the-websites/jquery-15-as-jquery-150/</link> <comments>/behind-the-websites/jquery-15-as-jquery-150/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2010 02:53:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Behind the Websites]]></category> <category><![CDATA[caching]]></category> <category><![CDATA[google]]></category> <category><![CDATA[JavaScript]]></category> <category><![CDATA[jQuery]]></category><guid

We still code in strict XHTML 1.0 for reasons that <a
href="/author/peter/" title="Peter Wilson  |  Big Red Tin">Peter</a> knows a lot better than I, but I suspect it has something to do with familiarity and knowing that it works. There&#8217;s a safety in that.</p><p>We believe very strongly in semantic mark-up and getting things working as much as possible in as many places. We believe in graceful degradation. I believe in closing tags once they&#8217;re opened and I didn&#8217;t like how HTML5 didn&#8217;t demand a trailing slash on stand alone elements. That just seemed like chaos.</p><p><a
href="http://adactio.com/" title="Adactio: Jeremy Keith">Jeremy Keith</a>&#8216;s new book, <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> is a no-nonsense 85 pages of the good and bad in the HTML5 specification. It explains how the spec is a lot more open and forgiving than previous specs. It also explains how much work was done to ensure better semantics than previous versions of HTML.</p><p>You&#8217;re probably thinking exactly what I was. How can any 85 page book tell me what I need to know about the largest HTML specification thus far? Is 85 pages even a book or is it more like an extended pamphlet? How can I take this seriously?</p><p>We bought the book largely because we trust the work <a
href="http://www.zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman Presents The Daily Report">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> does. This is the first book he has published under Happy Cog&#8217;s new <a
href="http://www.happycog.com/publish/abookapart/" title="A Book Apart: Happy Cog">A Book Apart</a> label. I thought that if anybody can get a writer to condense all the info I need into a short read, it&#8217;s Zeldman. But no pressure, JZ.</p><p>The important things it explains is how HTML5 can be used to include rich media on your websites, how it improves web forms (which got me really excited) and how it improves on semantics. And yes, it does actually explain them.</p><p>It explains these topics in enough detail that I could start using them today.</p><p>I want to keep learning and improving my knowledge of web-based coding. At the same time, <a

href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">a weekly podcast</a> and trying to have a life. It&#8217;s hard to keep up with all the details of a new spec.</p><p>It turns out, all I ever wanted was an 85 page book that explained everything I needed to know and cut out all the stuff I&#8217;ll never use. I don&#8217;t need a beginner&#8217;s book but I also don&#8217;t want an expert&#8217;s tome. I want an executive summary and that&#8217;s exactly what this book is.

title="@iamcracks" href="http://twitter.com/iamcracks/">@iamcracks</a> asked</p><blockquote><p>Attention WordPress Wizards &amp; Gurus. Is it possible to &#8220;get WordPress to write a custom field into a javascript variable&#8221;?</p><p>&#8211; <a
title="source" href="http://twitter.com/iamcracks/status/22658211370">source</a></p></blockquote><p>While I wouldn&#8217;t be so bold as to claim I&#8217;m either a wizard or a guru, I happen to know the answer to @iamcracks question.</p><p>A while back I wrote a two part tutorial on using <a
title="JavaScript the WordPress way" href="/behind-the-websites/javascript-the-wordpress-way-part-1/">JavaScript the WordPress way</a>, the code below builds on that. The first step is to load the JavaScript in functions.php using <code>wp_enqueue_script()</code> as detailed in the earlier tutorial:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
function brt_load_scripts() {
  if (!is_admin()) {
    wp_enqueue_script(
      'brt-sample-script', //handle
      '/path/2/script.js', //source
      null, //no dependancies
      '1.0.1', //version
      true //load in html footer
    );
  }
}

add_action('wp_print_scripts', 'brt_load_scripts');
?&gt;</code></pre><p>This outputs the html required for the JavaScript when <code>wp_footer()</code> is called in footer.php</p><p>Localising the script is done using the function <code>wp_localize_script()</code> it takes three variables:</p><ul><li><strong>$handle</strong> &#8211; (string) the handle defined when registering the script with wp_enqueue_script</li><li><strong>$javascriptObject</strong> &#8211; (string) name of the JavaScript object that contains the passed variables.</li><li><strong>$variables</strong> &#8211; (array) the variables to be passed</li></ul><p>To pass the site&#8217;s home page and the theme directory, we&#8217;d add this function call below the <code>wp_enqueue_script</code> call above:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
...
wp_localize_script('brt-sample-script', 'brtSampleVars', array(
  'url' =&gt; get_bloginfo('url'),
  'theme_dir' =&gt; get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory')
  )
);
...
?&gt;</code></pre><p>The output html would be:</p><pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
/* &lt;![CDATA[ */
var brtSampleVars = {
  url: "http://bigredtin.com",
  theme_dir: "/wp-content/themes/bigredtin"
};
/* ]]&gt; */
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/path/2/script.js?ver=1.0.1'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><p>Accessing the variables within JavaScript is done using the standard dot notation, for example <code>brtSampleVars.theme_dir</code> to access the theme directory.</p><p>Using a post&#8217;s custom fields is slightly more complicated so I&#8217;ll write out the code in full:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php
function brt_load_scripts() {
  if (is_singular()) {
    wp_enqueue_script(
      'brt-sample-script', //handle
      '/path/2/script.js', //source
      null, //no dependancies
      '1.0.1', //version
      true //load in html footer
    );

    the_post();
    $allPostMeta = get_post_custom();
    wp_localize_script('brt-sample-script', 'brtSampleVars',
    array(
      'petersTwitter' =&gt; $allPostMeta['myTwitter'][0],
      'joshsTwitter' =&gt; $allPostMeta['joshsTwitter'][0]
      )
    );
    rewind_posts();
  }
}

add_action('wp_print_scripts', 'brt_load_scripts');
?&gt;</code></pre><p>Only pages and posts have custom fields so the check at the start of the function has become <code>is_singlular()</code> to check the user is on either a post or a page, earlier we were testing if the user was anywhere on the front end. The arguments for <code>wp_enqueue_script</code> have not changed.</p><p><code>the_post()</code> needs to be called to start the loop and initiate the $post object so the associated custom fields can be accessed in the following line and put in an array.</p><p>With the custom fields easily available, the information can then be passed to <code>wp_localize_script()</code> as earlier demonstrated. The final step is to rewind the loop so next time <code>the_post()</code> is called, from either single.php or page.php, the post data is available.</p><p>The html output from the sample above would be:</p><pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
/* &lt;![CDATA[ */
var brtSampleVars = {
  petersTwitter: "@pwcc",
  joshsTwitter: "@sealfur"
};
/* ]]&gt; */
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/path/2/script.js?ver=1.0.1'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/javascript-localisation-in-wordpress/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Delay Print Stylesheets Plugin</title><link>/behind-the-websites/delay-print-css-plugin/</link> <comments>/behind-the-websites/delay-print-css-plugin/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2010 02:17:29 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Behind the Websites]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CSS]]></category> <category><![CDATA[JavaScript]]></category> <category><![CDATA[plugin]]></category> <category><![CDATA[WordPress]]></category><guid

title="adapted an idea from a zOompf article" href="/behind-the-websites/delay-loading-of-print-css/">adapted an idea from a zOompf article</a> to delay the loading of print stylesheets until after a web page has fully rendered. I finished that post with the following point/question:</p><blockquote><p>Another question to ask is whether all this is actually worth the effort – even when reduced through automation. On Big Red Tin, the print.css is 595 bytes, the delay in rendering is negligible.</p></blockquote><p>Chris and Jeff at <a
title="Digging into WordPress" href="http://digwp.com">Digging into WordPress</a> picked up the article and posted it on their site. In turn it was picked up elsewhere and became the surprise hit of the summer at Big Red Tin. Not bad when one is shivering through a bitter Melbourne winter.</p><p>As a result of the interest, I decided to convert the code from the original post into a plugin and add it to the WordPress plugin directory.</p><h4>Further Testing</h4><p>As I warned in the original article, I&#8217;d tested the code in very limited circumstances and found it had worked. Fine for a code sample but not enough for a sub version-1.0-release plugin. Additional testing showed:</p><ol><li>Stylesheets intended for IE, through conditional comments, were loading in all browsers</li><li>When loading multiple stylesheets, the correct order was not maintained in all browsers</li></ol><p>If jQuery was available I wanted to use it for JavaScript event management otherwise I&#8217;d use purpose-written JavaScript. There&#8217;s no point, after all, of worrying about the rendering delay caused by 600-1000 bytes only to load a 71KB (or 24KB <a
title="gzipped" href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/07/high_performanc_3.html">gzipped</a>) file in its place.</p><p>Other things I wanted to do included:</p><ol><li>Put the PHP in a class to reduce the risk of clashing function/class names</li><li>Put the JavaScript in its own namespace</li><li>Keep the output code as small as possible</li></ol><p>To support conditional comments for IE required adding each stylesheet within a separate &lt;script&gt; tag, using this method the output HTML takes the following form:</p><pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  // add global print.css
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt;
  &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
    // add ie6 specific print.css
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></pre><p>This violates my aim to keep output as small as possible but footprint has to take second place to bug-free. I could have translated the code to use <a
title="JavaScript conditional comments" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment#Conditional_Comment_in_JScript">JavaScript conditional comments</a> by translating the IE version to the JavaScript engine it uses but this could lead to future-proofing problems.</p><p>To maintain the order of stylesheets, I added each event to an array of functions and then used a single event to loop through the array of functions. If jQuery is used, I add multiple events because jQuery runs events on a first in first out basis.</p><p>Putting the PHP in a class and the JavaScript in its own namespace is fairly self-explanatory. <a
href="http://bit.ly/bBUXCh">Google is your friend</a> if you wish to read up further on this.</p><p>Minimising the footprint was also a simple step. I wrote the JavaScript out in full with friendly variable names. Once I was happy with the code, I ran the code through <a
href="http://refresh-sf.com/yui/">the YUI JavaScript compressor</a>, commented out the original JavaScript in the plugin file and output the compressed version in its place.</p><p>The JavaScript is output inline (within the HTML) to avoid additional HTTP requests. I was in two minds about this because browser caching is lost in the process. So it may change in a later version.</p><p>I&#8217;ve worked out another way to keep the footprint small. Rather than creating a function to pass the stylesheet&#8217;s URL and ID to <code>brt_print.add(url, id)</code>, I wrote out the full function for each style sheet. I&#8217;ll fix that in the next release.</p><p>You can <a

title="detailing browser performance with the CSS print media type" href="http://zoompf.com/blog/2009/12/browser-performance-problem-with-css-print-media-type">detailing browser performance with the CSS print media type</a>. In most recent browsers, Safari being the exception, the print stylesheet held up rendering of the page.</p><p>The zOomph article suggests a solution, to load print stylesheets using JavaScript once the page has  rendered (ie, on the <code>window.onload</code> event), with a backup for the JavaScript impaired. You can see their code in the original article.</p><h4>Automating the task for WordPress</h4><p>Most sites I develop are in WordPress so I decided to automate the process. This relies on using <code>wp_enqueue_style</code> to register the stylesheets:</p><pre><code>function enqueue_css(){
  if (!is_admin()){
    wp_enqueue_style (
      'bigred-print', /* handle */
      '/path-to/print.css', /* source */
      null, /* no requirements */
      '1.0', /* version */
      'print' /* media type */
    );
  }
}
add_action('wp_print_styles', 'enqueue_css');</code></pre><p>The above code will output the following HTML in the header:</p><pre><code>&lt;link rel='stylesheet' id='bigred-print-css'  href='/path-to/print.css?ver=1.0' type='text/css' media='print' /&gt;</code></pre><p>The first step is to wrap the above html in noscript tags, the WordPress <a
title="filter" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API#Filters">filter</a> <code>style_loader_tag</code> is ideal for this.</p><pre><code>function js_printcss($tag, $handle) {
  global $wp_styles;
  if ($wp_styles-&gt;registered[$handle]-&gt;args == 'print') {
    $tag = "&lt;noscript&gt;" . $tag . "&lt;/noscript&gt;";
  }
  return $tag;
}
add_filter('style_loader_tag', 'js_printcss', 5, 2);</code></pre><p>The filter runs for all stylesheets, regardless of media type, so the function checks for print stylesheets and wraps them in the <code>noscript</code> tag, other media types are left alone.</p><p>The first two arguments are the filter and function names respectively, the third argument specifies the timing (5 is the default) and the final argument tells WordPress how many arguments to pass to the filter – two – in this case $tag and $handle.</p><p>With the new filter, WordPress now outputs following HTML in the header:</p><pre><code>&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;link rel='stylesheet' id='bigred-print-css'  href='/path-to/print.css?ver=1' type='text/css' media='print' /&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;</code></pre><p>The next step is to add the JavaScript to load the stylesheets, we can do this by changing our original function, <code>js_printcss</code>, and making use of a global variable:</p><pre><code>$printCSS = '';

function js_printcss($tag, $handle){
  global $wp_styles, $printCSS;
  if ($wp_styles-&gt;registered[$handle]-&gt;args == 'print') {

    $tag = "&lt;noscript&gt;" . $tag . "&lt;/noscript&gt;";

    preg_match("/&lt;\s*link\s+[^&gt;]*href\s*=\s*[\"']?([^\"' &gt;]+)[\"' &gt;]/", $tag, $hrefArray);
    $href = $hrefArray[1];

    $printCSS .= "var cssNode = document.createElement('link');";
    $printCSS .= "cssNode.type = 'text/css';";
    $printCSS .= "cssNode.rel = 'stylesheet';";
    $printCSS .= "cssNode.href = '" . esc_js($href) . "';";
    $printCSS .= "cssNode.media = 'print';";
    $printCSS .= "document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(cssNode);";
  }
  return $tag;
}</code></pre><p>The code creates the PHP variable <code>$printCSS</code> globally, which is then called into the function using the global command.</p><p>After wrapping the tag in the <code>noscript</code> tags, the new function uses a regular expression to extract the URL of the stylesheet from the link tag and placing it the variable <code>$href</code>.</p><p>Having extracted the stylesheet&#8217;s URL, the function then appends the required JavaScript to the PHP global variable <code>$printCSS</code>.</p><p>The final step is to add the JavaScript to the footer of the HTML using the wp_footer action in WordPress. The PHP to do this is:</p><pre><code>function printCSS_scriptTags(){
  global $printCSS;
  if ($printCSS != '') {
    echo "&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n";
    echo "window.onload = function(){\n";
    echo $printCSS;
    echo "}\n&lt;/script&gt;";
  }
}

add_action('wp_footer', 'printCSS_scriptTags');</code></pre><p>The above code uses <code>window.onload</code> as dictated in the original article. A better method would be to use an event listener to do the work, for those using jQuery we would change the function to:</p><pre><code>function printCSS_scriptTags(){
  global $printCSS;
  if ($printCSS != '') {
    echo "&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n";
    echo "jQuery(window).ready(function(){\n";
    echo $printCSS;
    echo "});\n&lt;/script&gt;";
 }

}
add_action('wp_footer', 'printCSS_scriptTags');</code></pre><p>The above solution had been tested for very limited circumstances only and found to have worked. Were I to use the function in a production environment I would undertake further testing.</p><p>Another question to ask is whether all this is actually worth the effort – even when reduced through automation. On Big Red Tin, the print.css is 595 bytes, the delay in rendering is negligible.</p><p><strong>Update Aug 23, 2010</strong>: Fixed a type in the code block redefining <code>js_printcss</code>.</p><p><strong>Update Aug 27, 2010</strong>: I&#8217;ve decided to release this as a plugin, get the skinny and the plugin from the <a

title="war of words" href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/07/14/wordpress-and-thesis-go-to-battle-mullenweg-may-sue/">war of words</a> broke out overnight between Matt Mullenweg (the lead developer of WordPress) and Chris Pearson, the developer of the Thesis theme.</p><p>In brief, Mullenweg believes that, because WordPress is released under the <a
title="GPLv2 license" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GPLv2 license</a>, all themes and plugins developed for WordPress must also be released under the same license. Pearson disagrees.</p><p>This situation has never affected us directly at Soupgiant so we haven&#8217;t needed to, and this is important, ask our lawyer if my interpretation is correct. <strong>This is a layman&#8217;s opinion and should be treated as such</strong>.</p><p>The battle comes down to these clauses in the GPLv2 license:</p><blockquote><p>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third    parties under the terms of this License.</p><p>If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.</p><p>&#8211;source <a
title="GPLv2 license" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GPLv2 license</a></p></blockquote><p>Due to the second clause quoted above, I believe that Mullenweg is wrong. WordPress themes can operate on other blogging platforms with minimal changes. This has been done before with the <a
title="Sandbox theme for WordPress" href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox theme for WordPress</a> which was successfully ported to <a
title="Movable Type" href="http://plugins.movabletype.org/sandbox/">Movable Type</a>.</p><p>WordPress themes output <abbr>HTML</abbr> with a series of calls to the blogging platform. To output the post&#8217;s title and contents in our base theme, we use the code:</p><pre><code>&lt;h2 class="entry-title"&gt;&lt;?php the_title() ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
    &lt;?php the_content("Continue reading " . the_title('', '', false)); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>To output the same <abbr>HTML</abbr> in a Movable Type theme, we would output:</p><pre><code>&lt;h2 class="entry-title"&gt;&lt;$mt:EntryTitle$&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
    &lt;$mt:EntryBody$&gt; &lt;$mt:EntryMore$&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>In terms of a page&#8217;s output, the above code is a minor part of the page. <em>The theme&#8217;s template is mostly made up of HTML and CSS, HTML and CSS operate in the browser and not in the blogging platform</em>. It&#8217;s for that reason that I believe that Pearson is correct in this case.</p><p>I acknowledge that WordPress hooks may complicate the matter but these hooks output such a minor part of a theme&#8217;s HTML, that I consider the theme <em>uses</em> the platform but isn&#8217;t <em>derived</em> from the platform. I&#8217;ve left plugins out of this discussion as these are a more complicated matter: they can output HTML or they can build on the platform.</p><p>The above said, were I to release a WordPress theme I would probably release it under the GPL as a hat tip and thank you to the community that has assisted me so much. However, if the theme was as complicated as the Thesis theme, I may feel differently about the matter when it&#8217;s crunch time.</p><p>Again, this is a layman&#8217;s opinion and should be treated as such.
