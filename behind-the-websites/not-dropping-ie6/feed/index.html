isPermaLink="false">http://peterwilson.cc/?p=97#comment-100</guid> <description>Interesting comments. I still make sure websites are viewable in Ie6 and look decent. It really depends on the audience of what the website is for. If it&#039;s for web saavy college students at tech schools, I think you don&#039;t even have to think about it. But charging extra for IE6 development? That is VERY interesting, I will keep that in mind next time I end up taking another freelance job.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interesting comments.

isPermaLink="false">http://peterwilson.cc/?p=97#comment-99</guid> <description>I&#039;ve almost fully dropped support for IE6 at least actively testing for errors/bugs in IE6. Very little traffic at this point is IE6 and it saves me that much time, especially on the JavaScript side since we are not currently using a framework.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve almost fully dropped support for IE6 at least actively testing for errors/bugs in IE6.

isPermaLink="false">http://peterwilson.cc/?p=97#comment-98</guid> <description>I think that this article fails to see the main problem with IE which is that is not a standard complaint browser and that by any means you need to spend extra time and effort to make Website work with it specially as the Web moves forward and clients start asking for specific functionality.As a developer I have already placed numerous tools to deal with almost every little bug and crazy thing that IE6 has thrown my way. This has resulted in a lot of time, money and effort put into making this browser behave the way it is expected to behave according to the guidelines put forward and, we can say approved, by the Web Development community. Even so, I still run, on a daily basis, into unexpected behaviors specially when I am creating new scripts to improve on my interfaces or to accomplish something in a better way.By keeping support of IE6 at no extra charge or at no consequence for Microsoft, IE6 will still be a nightmare for us Web Developers and I think that 10 years of a bad browser is enough, specially when there are so many better alternatives to it. I think it is our duty as Web people to educate the masses, our clients into understanding that the IE icon is not the internet and merely a program used to surf the Web and as so, it can be changed for another better piece of software.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that this article fails to see the main problem with IE which is that is not a standard complaint browser and that by any means you need to spend extra time and effort to make Website work with it specially as the Web moves forward and clients start asking for specific functionality.</p><p>As a developer I have already placed numerous tools to deal with almost every little bug and crazy thing that IE6 has thrown my way.

isPermaLink="false">http://peterwilson.cc/?p=97#comment-96</guid> <description>I agree. I find that in XHTML strict *most* of the crazy ie6 things are predictable in advance. I just code in all the -3px hacks as I go and don&#039;t have a lot of problems.I&#039;d be interested to see recent statistics for who is still using ie6. I know that a lot of my clients only have ie6 installed, and can&#039;t get permission to install anything else. Amongst general users I&#039;d guess the percentage would be much smaller? But that&#039;s just a guess. Even my grandparents use firefox :D</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agree.

isPermaLink="false">http://peterwilson.cc/?p=97#comment-95</guid> <description>Recently I&#039;ve thought about charging extra for IE6 development. So still supporting it but not being part of core business. That is, not supporting it by default, only by request.I suppose the other side is to just include extra time in your quotes but it&#039;s better, I think, if we start clients thinking that maybe it&#039;s costing them money to still be using IE6. After all, it is largely businesses with locked down SOEs that are the major culprits. Even my parents upgraded to IE7.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#8217;ve thought about charging extra for IE6 development.
