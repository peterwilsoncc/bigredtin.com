In it he describes how it&#8217;s the small things that really make all the difference. These small things are the details.</p><p><img src="/files/2011/01/Jetstar-Seat-Checker-1-400w.png" alt="Jetstar Seat Chooser page" border="0" width="400" height="317" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;" title="Jetstar seat chooser as it currently appears" /><br /> A friend just booked a ticket on <a href="http://www.jetstar.com/au/en/index.aspx" title="Cheap flights - Jetstar Airways">Jetstar</a> while I watched (these are the things I do on my holidays). Jetstar&#8217;s ticketing system is pretty simple and straight-forward until you get to the seat choice page.</p><p>This is where confusion occurred. She clicked around for a bit but, very simply, just did not know what to do. The page confused her.</p><p>If you&#8217;re also confused, the squares with the stars, circles and crosses are seats. Some of those are seats that are already reserved (red with crosses), some cost extra because of their premium positions (up front or extra leg room). The squares with light grey and dark grey inside them are available.</p><p>Mostly the problems related to the tabs at the top of the seat chooser. See that the &#8220;Flight Back&#8221; tab is a dark grey and so are the headings on the sidebar areas on the left? This is a confusion of the visual grammar of the site (highlighted in the next image).</p><p><img src="/files/2011/01/Jetstar-Seat-Checker-1-headingColour.png" alt="Jetstar seat chooser with visual grammar highlighted" border="0" width="389" height="175" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;" title="Jetstar seat chooser with visual grammar highlighted" /><br /> In this context, a dark grey background means &#8220;heading&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible to make this even more specific and uniform and say that a dark grey heading background with capitalised, italicised and white text means &#8220;heading&#8221;.</p><p>Because of this initial confusion, something else I hadn&#8217;t expected happened. The visual grammar prompted her to imagine a separation line extending down from the edge of the tabs. The way she initially read the page, the left half of the little boxes were for seats on the flight out and the right-hand-side were for seats on the way home. Because three little boxes did not correlate with her knowledge of aeroplane seating, she was at a complete loss of what to do.</p><p>The tasks she expected to be able to perform on this page and the information she received from the page were at odds with each other and a kind of user paralysis settled on her mouse hand. I&#8217;ve seen this user paralysis before. The user eventually gets over it and figures out what the page is asking of them or they give up and shop elsewhere. Either way, they think less of the website and the company as a result of their negative experience.</p><p>The very same thing happened to me when using <a href="http://www.myki.com.au/" title="myki - it's your key">the Myki website</a> for the first time to purchase my card. I only persevered out of professional interest for how to make a poor user experience. If I was anybody else I would just continue to buy my public transport tickets at the local milk bar.</p><p>A lack of attention to detail causes user paralysis. Very few website producers manage to create a website without something that could lead to this, but it happens most often in forms. It&#8217;s one of the reasons that user testing is so important. It&#8217;s also a good reason to have some budget up your sleeve to make a whole bunch of tiny changes about 6 months after the website launches.</p><p>When we&#8217;re building websites we try to preempt what a user will experience. If we skip steps in designing these experiences, or rush, or miscommunicate some ideas, we are in danger of spoiling the user&#8217;s opinion of the company, our client.</p><p>We ask a lot of questions of our clients because the way their customers use their websites will be a vital part of their business. Sometimes this means finding out a lot about how the business works. Sometimes it means asking questions that the client thinks irrelevant or has never really thought about before. It&#8217;s hard work for all involved but it&#8217;s exactly through this process that we get to identify a lot of the details we need to include in the website.</p><p>Some tiny details are all that the Jetstar seat checker required to make it more obvious on how to proceed:</p><ol><li>Make the active tab consistent with the heading styles;</li><li>Create some lines of demarkation between the tabs to make their seperation more obvious;</li><li>Identify the windows and aisles of the aeroplane;</li><li>Declare the type of aeroplane to give a better idea of what the user is looking at.</li></ol><p>I&#8217;ve created my own version of this in the image below. I am, by no means, a graphic designer, so please excuse the sloppy work. The point, however, is that it wouldn&#8217;t take very much work to fix this, but it&#8217;s also really easy to see how something this small could be missed the first time around.<br /> <img src="/files/2011/01/Jetstar-Seat-Checker-1-fixed.png" alt="Jetstar seat chooser with some extra details" border="0" width="650" height="515" title="Jetstar seat chooser with some extra details" /></p><p>My friend would have worked out the page within about 30 seconds but she shouldn&#8217;t have had to work at all. All the work should have been done for her beforehand. Our job is to make website interaction as obvious as possible. Doing that takes a lot of attention to detail.<span id="more-1026"></span></p><p>And now, enjoy learning a little bit more about details from Rory Sutherland:</p><p><object width="446" height="326"><param name="movie" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff"></param><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/RorySutherland_2010S-medium.flv&#038;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/RorySutherland-2010S.embed_thumbnail.jpg&#038;vw=432&#038;vh=240&#038;ap=0&#038;ti=880&#038;introDuration=15330&#038;adDuration=4000&#038;postAdDuration=830&#038;adKeys=talk=rory_sutherland_sweat_the_small_stuff;year=2010;theme=design_like_you_give_a_damn;theme=not_business_as_usual;theme=new_on_ted_com;theme=unconventional_explanations;event=TEDSalon+London+2010;&#038;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /><embed src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" pluginspace="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" bgColor="#ffffff" width="446" height="326" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/RorySutherland_2010S-medium.flv&#038;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/RorySutherland-2010S.embed_thumbnail.jpg&#038;vw=432&#038;vh=240&#038;ap=0&#038;ti=880&#038;introDuration=15330&#038;adDuration=4000&#038;postAdDuration=830&#038;adKeys=talk=rory_sutherland_sweat_the_small_stuff;year=2010;theme=design_like_you_give_a_damn;theme=not_business_as_usual;theme=new_on_ted_com;theme=unconventional_explanations;event=TEDSalon+London+2010;"></embed></object></p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/design/details-prevent-user-paralysis/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Branding is hard</title><link>/quick-notes/branding-is-hard/</link> <comments>/quick-notes/branding-is-hard/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2010 10:03:40 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Quick Notes]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">/?p=965</guid> <description><![CDATA[Making a great brand starts with having a great name and that means being able to buy a great or, at least, good domain name as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jason" title="Calacanis on Twitter">Jason Calacanis</a> explains.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s going to be a ton of hard work to get really good, and sometimes great, domain names.

It was described to me as meaning a form of idiot-proofing but it really means &#8220;mistake proofing&#8221;. Pieces of the car are manufactured in such a way that they can only be used on one particular part of the car.</p><p>Everything that we create when producing websites should exist on this level of poka yoke design. The goal in user interface design is to remove all ambiguity so that each part of the website can only be used in one particular way.</p><p>This is a lot more difficult than it seems. Take, for example, the simple hyperlink. So often, when analysing an existing website I see the words &#8220;click here&#8221; either preceding or following an instruction.</p><p><img src="/files/2010/11/CD6297F2-3E84-439B-AEF8-3ABD3890AE2A.jpg" alt="CD6297F2-3E84-439B-AEF8-3ABD3890AE2A.jpg" border="0" width="202" height="227" align="left" alt="Peerless Foods website with buttons that says 'view'" />In the case of the <a href="http://www.peerlessfoods.com.au/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=50" title="Peerless Foods :: Copha Vegetable Shortening">Peerless Foods website</a>, which I was shown on the weekend, there&#8217;s simply the word &#8220;view&#8221; near some text. (See the image to the left.)</p><p>To some it might seem like &#8220;click here&#8221; or &#8220;view&#8221; is the perfect example of poka yoke. It&#8217;s a link and we&#8217;re supposed to click on it and that&#8217;s what it says. But the design* has failed.</p><p>Creating a website design requires making as few assumptions about the user as possible. One of those assumptions might be that the user knows how to use a mouse. That might seem like a reasonable assumption but what about people who use other interactive devices? What about just keyboard or suck and blow straws or touch screens.</p><p>So the minimal assumption has to be that the user realises that there is an interactive device that they can manipulate in a way that will be reflected on the feedback device (screen or screen reader etc., from now on just referred to as &#8220;screen&#8221;).</p><p>So the user moves the cursor around the screen. It&#8217;s the feedback that we provide as designers that tells the user to activate that link. Sometimes that&#8217;s as simple as a different colour text with an underline. Sometimes that&#8217;s a hover state that alters the size of an element. Maybe the cursor changes from an arrow to a hand. Maybe it&#8217;s just as simple as making sure that the right html tags were used.</p><p>There&#8217;s a usability adage that <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/the-evolution-of-door-usability/" title="The Evolution of Door Usability | UX Booth">if there needs to be a sign on the door that says &#8220;push&#8221;, the designer of the door has failed</a>. That fact that the door needs to be pushed to open should be implicit in its design.</p><p>It&#8217;s tempting to put a &#8220;click here&#8221; at the end of a sentence because it&#8217;s the easiest thing for the content creator to do but it complicates issues for the user of the website. It&#8217;s clumsy and it reflects poorly on everybody involved in creating the website.</p><p>Most importantly, it&#8217;s not mistake proof. On the Peerless Foods website, those little green buttons don&#8217;t give the user any extra information. In fact, it&#8217;s not clear that they are even related to the information above them.</p><p>A bit of text that says &#8220;if you want to contact us, <a href="http://soupgiant.com/contact/" title="Contact  |  Soupgiant">click here</a>&#8221; is nowhere near as succinct and obvious as one that just says &#8220;<a href="http://soupgiant.com/contact/" title="Contact  |  Soupgiant">contact us</a>&#8220;.</p><p>For more reading on website usability, we recommend <a href="http://www.useit.com/" title="useit.com: Jakob Nielsen on Usability and Web Design">the writings of Jakob Neilson</a>, and Steve Krug&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789723107?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=boxcutters-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0789723107">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think!</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=boxcutters-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0789723107" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. There&#8217;s also a great <a href="http://example.com/">book about the usability and design of doors and kettles</a> by Donald A. Norman.</p><p>*when I talk about design I include content because it&#8217;s an important part of how people interact with a site. I also include the choice of HTML tags.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/design/poka-yoke-ux-design/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>3</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Simplifying can complicate things</title><link>/business/simplifying-can-complicate-things/</link> <comments>/business/simplifying-can-complicate-things/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2010 18:49:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[clients]]></category> <category><![CDATA[communication]]></category> <category><![CDATA[planning]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">/?p=847</guid> <description><![CDATA[I've played with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5604687/google-halts-wave-development-shutting-it-down-by-end-of-year" title="Google Halts Wave Development, Shutting It Down By End of Year">Google Wave</a> (<abbr title="Of Blessed Memory">OBM</abbr>) and toyed with <a href="http://pbworks.com/" title="PBworks: Online Collaboration">PBWorks</a>.

In the past I&#8217;ve literally spent days (if not weeks) looking for a good project tracking tool, or a group collaboration tool.</p><p>I&#8217;ve played with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5604687/google-halts-wave-development-shutting-it-down-by-end-of-year" title="Google Halts Wave Development, Shutting It Down By End of Year">Google Wave</a> (<abbr title="Of Blessed Memory">OBM</abbr>) and toyed with <a href="http://pbworks.com/" title="PBworks: Online Collaboration">PBWorks</a>. I tried wikis and intranets, I implemented networks and created complicated Excel spreadsheets. I have used at least five different time trackers and even more wireframing tools.</p><p>None of those things ever helped get the work completed quicker, more efficiently or better in any way.</p><p>I have largely learnt my lesson from this and mostly stick to the processes I know.</p><p>So, when a client recently asked me to create a software solution to a clearly inefficient business process I panicked and told them the first idea that came to mind. That idea was a complicated online spreadsheet and I am yet to implement it because I fear it&#8217;s just another distraction.</p><p>I&#8217;ve never found anything in web technologies as efficient or simple for managing workflow as a well-planned whiteboard.</p><p>My favourite whiteboard is the one in<cite><a href="http://www.tv.com/show/110/summary.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street on TV.com">Homicide: Life on the Streets</a></cite>. It sits up on the wall in the homicide office and features the names of the detectives and the cases they&#8217;re working on. An unsolved case is written in red marker and when it is solved it&#8217;s rewritten in black.</p><p>Red and black. That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s easy to look at the board and instantly see where everything is up to.</p><p>There are, however, two problems with a whiteboard:<br /> 1) It is, to an extent, transient. There&#8217;s no permanent or historical record to refer to.<br /> 2) There is no way for people to refer to it remotely. People might need to access the information while &#8220;on-site&#8221;.</p><p>These problems/requirements complicate the issue. It&#8217;s quite easy to have an elegantly simple solution to a simple problem but this is not a simple problem.</p><p>It&#8217;s a problem that many businesses face. The person who started the business has a lot of information in her head. She has also tracked jobs and written notes in a series of notebooks. It made perfect sense to her when the business was just her and her business partner but then her business grew. Over time more and more people needed to access that information.</p><p>I&#8217;ve worked for people who would ponder on a problem for a frustratingly long time. They would sit and reject idea after idea until they ran out of time to act. I&#8217;m often the opposite and I&#8217;ll jump on a solution, try it and then discard it a while later. Neither is good for business.</p><p>What I keep forgetting, though, is that the excellent whiteboard in <em>Homicide</em> probably wasn&#8217;t the first system they tried in that office filled with detectives. There must have been a time when the Baltimore police department didn&#8217;t have an elegantly simple solution for keeping score of investigations.</p><p>The key is to ask at every step, &#8220;Is this leading to a simpler way?&#8221; My client&#8217;s problem started as a simple process and was complicated over time. My job is <em>not</em> to make it more complicated.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/simplifying-can-complicate-things/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Networking is the New Networking</title><link>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/</link> <comments>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2010 20:42:44 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[exposure]]></category> <category><![CDATA[marketing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[networking]]></category> <category><![CDATA[selling]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">/?p=812</guid> <description><![CDATA[Networking is not about shoving your business cards in people's faces.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had the opportunity to co-present a panel at <a href="http://www.aussiecon4.org.au/" title="AussieCon4 :: Home">AussieCon 4</a>, which is what <a href="http://www.worldcon.org/" title="World Science Fiction Society / Worldcon [Official]">WorldCon</a> is called when it&#8217;s in Australia. WorldCon, for the uninitiated, is the World Science Fiction Convention. An annual event held at a different location somewhere in the world.</p><p>I was there in my capacity as one of the hosts of <a href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">Boxcutters</a>. We were presenting and recording a panel. It was wonderful to meet a lot of people who already enjoyed the podcast and those who seemed interested in downloading it.</p><p>Actually, it was just wonderful to meet a lot of people.</p><p>My experience at <a href="http://sxsw.com/" title="SXSW.com">SxSW</a> earlier this year was similar.</p><p>These conventions are not just about learning things. In fact, and let&#8217;s be honest here, they&#8217;re not really about learning things in panel sessions. They&#8217;re about being around like-minded people who might be interested in what you do and vice-versa. They&#8217;re about meeting people.</p><p>I went to a few &#8220;networking&#8221; evenings arranged by various &#8220;small business&#8221; groups back when I ran my first business a few years ago. There was too much pressure on those nights. People would be busy sussing other people out, swapping business cards and big-noting themselves. It felt really sleazy and desperate.</p><p>Networking is not about desperation. It&#8217;s just about meeting people. Some of them will be useful to you, some of them will find you useful, some will become actual friends and others will be forgotten.</p><p>The point is, though, that actual physical exposure is what is important.

It simplifies a topic and gets me excited about using new web technologies.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We haven&#8217;t yet moved onto HTML5 at Soupgiant. We still code in strict XHTML 1.0 for reasons that <a href="/author/peter/" title="Peter Wilson  |  Big Red Tin">Peter</a> knows a lot better than I, but I suspect it has something to do with familiarity and knowing that it works. There&#8217;s a safety in that.</p><p>We believe very strongly in semantic mark-up and getting things working as much as possible in as many places. We believe in graceful degradation. I believe in closing tags once they&#8217;re opened and I didn&#8217;t like how HTML5 didn&#8217;t demand a trailing slash on stand alone elements. That just seemed like chaos.</p><p><a href="http://adactio.com/" title="Adactio: Jeremy Keith">Jeremy Keith</a>&#8216;s new book, <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> is a no-nonsense 85 pages of the good and bad in the HTML5 specification. It explains how the spec is a lot more open and forgiving than previous specs. It also explains how much work was done to ensure better semantics than previous versions of HTML.</p><p>You&#8217;re probably thinking exactly what I was. How can any 85 page book tell me what I need to know about the largest HTML specification thus far? Is 85 pages even a book or is it more like an extended pamphlet? How can I take this seriously?</p><p>We bought the book largely because we trust the work <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman Presents The Daily Report">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> does. This is the first book he has published under Happy Cog&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.happycog.com/publish/abookapart/" title="A Book Apart: Happy Cog">A Book Apart</a> label. I thought that if anybody can get a writer to condense all the info I need into a short read, it&#8217;s Zeldman. But no pressure, JZ.</p><p>The important things it explains is how HTML5 can be used to include rich media on your websites, how it improves web forms (which got me really excited) and how it improves on semantics. And yes, it does actually explain them.</p><p>It explains these topics in enough detail that I could start using them today.</p><p>I want to keep learning and improving my knowledge of web-based coding. At the same time, <a href="http://soupgiant.com/" title="Soupgiant | Web Production">I&#8217;m running a business now</a> as well as continuing to produce <a href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">a weekly podcast</a> and trying to have a life. It&#8217;s hard to keep up with all the details of a new spec.</p><p>It turns out, all I ever wanted was an 85 page book that explained everything I needed to know and cut out all the stuff I&#8217;ll never use. I don&#8217;t need a beginner&#8217;s book but I also don&#8217;t want an expert&#8217;s tome. I want an executive summary and that&#8217;s exactly what this book is. If that&#8217;s all you need, look no further.</p><p><a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers" title="A Book Apart, HTML5 For Web Designers"><em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> by Jeremy Keith</a> is available from the A List Apart store in paperback or ePub.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/html5-for-web-designers-9/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>An Answer to the Twitter Question</title><link>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/</link> <comments>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2010 06:45:40 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[advertising]]></category> <category><![CDATA[buzz]]></category> <category><![CDATA[promotion]]></category> <category><![CDATA[publicity]]></category> <category><![CDATA[social networks]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Twitter]]></category> <category><![CDATA[zeitgeist]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">/?p=702</guid> <description><![CDATA[One of the questions we're often asked by clients when doing an initial consultation is "what about twitter?" After a couple of years of thinking about an answer, Josh might finally have one.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions we&#8217;re often asked by clients when doing an initial consultation is &#8220;what about twitter?&#8221; It goes along with &#8220;should we have a Facebook page?&#8221; and &#8220;how do I get MySpace friends?&#8221;</p><p>Social networking, of the web-based variety, is something that people will be writing books about for years to come. It&#8217;s as hot now as it was 3 years ago and 5 years ago. That is to say, it continues to be hot because there continue to be new social networks that become popular and die out and then become popular and then die out again.</p><p>The trick for a business is to be able to appropriately surf that wave of social network highs and lows and never put all eggs into a single basket.</p><p>There are big businesses that do great work on Twitter. Airlines like <a href="http://twitter.com/virginblue">Virgin Blue</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/southwestair">Southwest</a> have a team dedicated to monitoring social websites to see what people are saying about them. So do telecommunications companies like <a href="http://twitter.com/optus">Optus</a>.</p><p>For customers the advantage is that they can have a direct line to vent their frustrations. Shout out on Twitter about how outrageously incorrect your bill seems to be and you can not only have friends console you or also share their experiences, but there&#8217;s a fairly good chance someone from the company will be in touch to help you through your issue.</p><p>For companies the advantage is largely and expectedly the reverse. It&#8217;s easy to monitor exactly what people are saying about your company, your industry or your competitors. It&#8217;s also really easy to reach out to a customer and make them feel a little bit special by personally helping them with their problem.</p><p>Twitter, however, is not the place to try to influence customers or get them to change their habits. It is not as effective as an advertising campaign or a media release but it is a good place to see what people are saying about your latest ad campaign etc. Twitter for companies is more about measurement and accessibility than direct marketing and that&#8217;s important to remember.</p><p>Nobody likes to be spammed at. Nobody needs to get a direct message because they followed your company. People don&#8217;t hang around with Twitter because they enjoy being bombarded with irrelevant messages. They use the service because it helps them feel connected and part of a community. That&#8217;s important to remember because, while it might be hard to build up a good reputation on Twitter, it will only take minutes to be burnt and razed to the ground with no one around to sweep up your ashes.</p><p>A <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tb/tb100809comic-con_and_hollyw">recent radio piece about Comic-Con</a> featured a genre film promoter talking about changing people&#8217;s opinions and excitement about a product. He told a story about going to Comic-Con to convince an audience of die-hard <em>Batman</em> fans that the, then, new movie (1989) would not be the camp 1960s <em>Batman</em> despite the involvement of the director of a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/">Pee-Wee Herman film</a> and the guy from <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085970/">Mr Mom</a></em>. Within minutes he managed to turn the audience from a booing mass to applauding fans excited with anticipation.</p><p>An opinion turn-around like that could never be achieved on Twitter. The value Twitter has, though, is that if something like that were to happen today, the people in that room would tweet about it and excitement about the product would spread exponentially and almost instantly</p><p>Twitter is the buzz. If our clients are on Twitter they are in a much better position to have their finger on the pulse and give them more information about the zeitgeist. They might not have a million followers but at the very least they&#8217;ll be able to gauge influence.</p><p>Twitter gives companies the ability to do something they&#8217;ve never done before. They have a direct link into their customers&#8217; thoughts and conversations. That&#8217;s a very powerful tool and it needs to be approached with patience and a lot of thought.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Use Experience to build Experience</title><link>/design/use-experience-to-build-experience/</link> <comments>/design/use-experience-to-build-experience/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2010 00:49:36 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Design]]></category> <category><![CDATA[experience]]></category> <category><![CDATA[online stores]]></category> <category><![CDATA[process flow]]></category> <category><![CDATA[retail]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">/?p=666</guid> <description><![CDATA[Real world experience counts for a lot when developing for an online world. Sure, it sounds trite but it's frighteningly true. Working on redesigning the user interface for an online store, I found myself digging deep into my own experiences to be able to anticipate the needs of the customer.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working on redesigning the user interface for an online store, I found myself digging deep into my own experiences to be able to anticipate the needs of the customer.</p><p>For 8 years, from the ages of 14 to 22, I worked in retail. My parents ran a couple of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manchester">manchester</a> stores and I worked there after school and on weekends. In two of those years I also worked in a video library*.</p><p>The thing about designing for the web is, we often don&#8217;t take into account, not only what our audience&#8217;s real-world experience is, but also our own.</p><p>When laying out a &#8216;brick &amp; mortar&#8217; retail store, there is a logical flow to entice customers further in. A clothing retailer, for example, has the changing rooms at the back of the store so you have to walk past all the racks first. Trestle tables with specials are outside the store to entice the customer to come in.</p><p>&#8216;Brick &#038; mortar&#8217; stores have their differences to online stores but customers expect a similar experience. The shopping brain has certain established neural pathways. It&#8217;s easier to capitalise on those than to try to forge new pathways.</p><p>When I explained the concept of the customer&#8217;s journey through the store to my client I could speak with experienced knowledge of how a customer expects to be treated.</p><p>I was able to draw on my knowledge and experience in working with shoppers to design and explain how an online shop needs to feel. I used parts of the screen real-estate as if they were parts of the shop floor:</p><ul><li>The shopping cart is like the cashier&#8217;s counter. It needs to be visible, obvious but unobtrusive to the flow of the store. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s in the top right, squarish and about one third the width of the content area.</li><li>The front page is like the window-dressing. It needs to show popular, attractive, sought-after, and new items in an enticing way. It&#8217;s a lot easier in a web-store because you can actually give areas of the screen titles like &#8220;Popular Items&#8221;, &#8220;Highest Rated&#8221; and &#8220;Recently Added&#8221;. Cookies and user history also give the opportunity to tailor the store to the visitor.</li><li>There&#8217;s a section of the front page that has a different coloured header and displays some heavily discounted items like the trestle tables on the footpath in front of the shop.</li></ul><p>There are plenty of times when I&#8217;ve worked on websites in areas of business where I didn&#8217;t have 8 years&#8217; experience. In those situations I&#8217;ve sat down with clients and asked them to show me every aspect of their business I can think of. I go through business processes with them for hours so that I can accurately recreate real world experiences.</p><p>We have a tendency, because we work with computers, to isolate ourselves from the real world. We forget, sometimes, that people in the real world often just want to replicate their own experience with some added convenience. It&#8217;s up to us to be able to capture the essence of the real world to make our audiences feel more comfortable online. Sometimes that means digging into our own past and sometimes it means distilling someone else&#8217;s knowledge but the aim should always remain: Make the user&#8217;s transition from real world to online as seamless as possible.</p><p><em>*The older people in the audience may need to explain that concept to the young &#8216;uns.</em></p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/design/use-experience-to-build-experience/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Designing a User Interface with Caveat Emptor</title><link>/design/designing-a-user-interface-with-caveat-emptor/</link> <comments>/design/designing-a-user-interface-with-caveat-emptor/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2010 01:52:33 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Design]]></category> <category><![CDATA[amazon]]></category> <category><![CDATA[communication]]></category> <category><![CDATA[ecommerce]]></category> <category><![CDATA[expectations]]></category> <category><![CDATA[kindle]]></category> <category><![CDATA[shopping]]></category> <category><![CDATA[usability]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">/?p=617</guid> <description><![CDATA[There are lots of elements that go into making a good online store. One of the most important is that customers have access to all the information they need to make an informed decision.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=boxcutters-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Amazon Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=boxcutters-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B0015T963C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> came into my life.</p><p>To test it out I obtained a free copy of <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=UFhlhCvQigkC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=hound+of+the+baskervilles&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=6BDrd2XvtZ&#038;sig=7gnwjXpUalRLTHxlTqvMbzKZV7w&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=aXkyTI2sO463cbHI2bgD&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=3&#038;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a> from the online store and started reading. I was an instant convert. I loved the experience and I loved the concept.</p><p>Until, that is , I found my way into Chapter 2 and there were vital passages missing from the text. It soiled my experience with the Kindle.</p><p>There are a number of lessons here. Obviously, there&#8217;s the whole <em>caveat emptor</em>, you get what you pay for scenario. A little bit of research would have shown me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RX146XZB1IJWQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">this review</a> that tells me up-front what to expect:</p><blockquote><p> This edition is missing certain passages&#8230; Whenever there is a point in the story where a character reads out of a newspaper or other document, that passage is missing from this Kindle edition. Spend a dollar and get a different version.</p></blockquote><p>But the other lesson is more a question for thought. Why would Amazon keep the book in their store if it&#8217;s not what people are expecting? There is no obvious avenue to inform Amazon of the problem with the book and no way to ask them to remove the book so other people don&#8217;t fall into the same trap.</p><p>When building the user interface of an online store, there are many things to take into account. Feedback is vital for any business. Amazon and <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a> have built empires with great customer service but customer service is about a lot more than just an attentive complaints department or a good returns policy.</p><p>Great customer service starts with the user interface. It&#8217;s the experience a customer has when they browse or purchase a product. A bad UI is like having a rude salesperson on the shop floor. A customer should be able to trust that the seller is looking out for them. There should be a way to bring issues of faulty products to the attention of the sellers.</p><p>Sometimes there are use-cases that just aren&#8217;t foreseen. But when they reveal themselves it&#8217;s important for an online store to be able to adapt.</p><p>So there are things that Amazon could have implemented to make my experience better. A roll-over information box that showed me the start of the most helpful review, for example, could have given me the information I needed to make my decision to purchase or not.</p><p>These are the small design things; the small usability things that we try to develop every day.</p><p>Recently I designed some wireframes for an online store. It&#8217;s hard. I had to balance the client&#8217;s budget with the limited information I had, the inclusion and prioritisation of use-cases, and a degree of future-proofing to allow for unforeseen developments.</p><p>There is a lot of information to include in an online store. There are lots of buttons and lots of icons to demand a customer&#8217;s attention. It&#8217;s important to remember, however, that customers want something very simple: They want to buy stuff and for it to behave as expected. Give them that and the rest will follow.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/design/designing-a-user-interface-with-caveat-emptor/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
