isPermaLink="false">/?p=882#comment-1892</guid> <description>A bit of text that says &#039;contact us&#039; is succinct, but it&#039;s only obvious if the user can see that clicking on it will do something. I think most people understand that coloured and underlined is a link, but they can get confused if links are presented in another way, or if there is coloured and underlined text that is not clickable.Buttons are a bit harder, because some look clickable and some don&#039;t. For example, the presentation and the position of the &#039;POST A COMMENT&#039; text makes me suspect it&#039;s clickable, but I&#039;m only sure when I mouse over it and it changes colour.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bit of text that says &#8216;contact us&#8217; is succinct, but it&#8217;s only obvious if the user can see that clicking on it will do something.
