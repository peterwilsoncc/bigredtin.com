title="No CSS Reset" href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/no_css_reset/">why he doesn&#8217;t use a reset.css</a> in which he referred to Eric Meyer&#8217;s reset, a short time later, <a
title="Crafting Ourselves" href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2008/04/17/crafting-ourselves/">Eric Meyer responded</a> with an article of his own. Unlike many discussions on the web, it wasn&#8217;t a mudslinging match, but a sincere discussion of the tools available to web developers.</p><p>My initial thoughts were that a reset style sheet, combined with a base style sheet, was a <em>helpful</em> place to start any web project as it reduces the incidence of unexpected results. I thought it was important for the developer to have her own reset and base styles; blindly adopting someone else&#8217;s reset and base style sheets will just lead to a different set of surprises.</p><p><span
id="more-53"></span>While these discussions were going on, I was in the process of developing my own base style sheets, running them against <a
title="YUI XHTML Test" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/base/base-simple_source.html">YUI&#8217;s XHTML test suite</a>; shortly afterwards I began to regret the decisions I&#8217;d made.</p><p>I concluded that the best place to start was with my own <a
title="Peter Wilson Base XHTML document" href="http://code.peterwilson.cc/dont-start-with-a-reset-css/">base XHTML document</a>, something I can start a project with and remove anything that&#8217;s not needed for the particular project.</p><p>Viewing the source of my base XHTML you&#8217;ll see an overly complicated document that will never be used in its entirety on a single project.</p><pre><code>&lt;div id="content-body"&gt;
  &lt;div id="content-a"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!-- //#content-a --&gt;

  &lt;div id="content-b"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!-- //#content-b --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- //#content-body --&gt;</code></pre><p>In a project with a single column of content, there is no point in dividing the content into content-a and content-b; that&#8217;s a deliberate redundancy, I&#8217;d much rather highlight a block of code and hit delete than re-write type the code every time I need it. The same process applies for sidebar-a and -b.</p><p>None of this is to say that base style sheets are bad, they&#8217;re still very useful tools, just that it is important to begin with something to run your styles against.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/dont-start-with-a-resetcss/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
