title="Soupgiant" href="http://soupgiant.com">Soupgiant</a>, included a couple of notes for our very patient designer, <a
title="Christa at Zepol" href="http://zepol.com.au">Christa at Zepol</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The frame of both sites will be pretty similar. We were thinking of different colour schemes [...] as a way of demarcating the two sites.</p><p>We haven&#8217;t got an exact style in mind, but something relaxed and modern without going over the top &#8211; <em>Web 1.5 if you like</em>.</p><p>— source: email to Zepol (emphasis added for this post)</p></blockquote><p>The rest of the brief detailed the <a
title="content separation" href="/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/">content separation</a> between Soupgiant and Big Red Tin. We wanted the design to come from the designer to fit the content, not from a committee to fit some other agenda.</p><p>In the context of this site&#8217;s design, the exact interpretation of Web 1.5 was left to Christa&#8217;s devices. As should the exact interpretation of any design brief.</p><p>To me, web 1.5 means something like: <strong>dump all the cliches of Web 2.0 design, at the same time keep the good bits</strong></p><p>&#8220;A good bit&#8221; may be a feature that is used frequently, such as oversized footers, because it adds something for users of the site. Cliches are those design tricks that add nothing but appear on every second web site, such as elements with faded backgrounds and rounded corners.</p><p>It strikes me, as a developer, it must be said that the definition of design is something similar: <strong>dump all the cliches and keep all the good bits</strong></p><p>Failing to do so risks rendering you a regurgitator, not a designer.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/design/web-1-5/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>MYOB Invoices: Building Brand Identity</title><link>/business/myob-invoices-building-brand-identity/</link> <comments>/business/myob-invoices-building-brand-identity/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2009 23:23:26 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[accounting]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Design]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Gimp]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Invoices]]></category> <category><![CDATA[MYOB]]></category><guid

This is why we went with MYOB and how we're dealing with the headaches.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we sat down with our accountant to get some tips on starting up, we asked him what accounting software package we should use.</p><p>I had used the open source <a
href="http://gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a> before and I liked it. I felt like what we lost in localised specificity we gained by saving the hundreds of dollars charged by the local accounting package duopoly.</p><p>Peter had used <a
href="http://home.quicken.com.au/Pages/HomePage.aspx">Quicken</a> and wasn&#8217;t very happy with it. Similarly, in previous businesses, I&#8217;d used <a
href="http://myob.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1105078110482&amp;pagename=MYOB%2FPage%2FHomePageTemplate&amp;site=en_AU&amp;c=Page">MYOB</a> and thought it sported some of the worst user interface design I&#8217;ve ever seen in software.</p><p>The accountant told us that MYOB was the go. His logic was similar to mine but probably more financially sound. Forking out the $300 now would save us potentially thousands in accounting fees in the future. That made sense to us.<br

/> I believe that strongly in creating a brand identity as early as possible. When a client receives an invoice, there&#8217;s a statement one business makes to another about how much they care about their appearance.</p><p>The default invoice in MYOB is not going to cut it in the same way the default WordPress template or having an email address with Hotmail just makes a new business seem unprofessional.</p><p>MYOB&#8217;s default invoices are ugly. They are just text. Sometimes the text doesn&#8217;t fit inside the borders they themselves have created. Sometimes the text looks like it&#8217;s just floating on the page in some sort of information limbo.</p><p>Anybody who has ever tried to design an MYOB invoice template inside MYOB knows that it would be easier to tattoo your invoices onto a chicken and train that chicken to walk to your client and present itself.</p><p>The design interface is terrible. It&#8217;s unclear when if a change is going to affect one element or all of them. There&#8217;s also a whole lot of shouting &#8220;where did that thing just go?&#8221;</p><p>It turns out that MYOB is set up for those who like to print out invoices and send them via post. Also, they want to have pre-printed invoice templates that just need the information dumped on them.</p><p>Of course, not living in the 1980s, and happy to just deliver our invoices via an emailed PDF, we needed to work out a way around this. Apparently it&#8217;s easy to attach a background image to the invoice so we&#8217;re trying to design one that way.</p><p>The idea is that we print a pdf of an invoice, import that into Gimp and then add design elements in different layers. When we&#8217;re happy with what we have we remove the pdf layer, save the file as a png and upload it into MYOB as a background.</p><p>We&#8217;re still in the process of designing so we&#8217;ll let you know how it goes.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/myob-invoices-building-brand-identity/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
