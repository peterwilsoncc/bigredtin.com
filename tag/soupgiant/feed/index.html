title="how the name Soupgiant" href="/opinion/names-will-never-harm-you/">how the name Soupgiant</a> came about. To summarise, it was a remarkably simple process.</p><p>Deciding to start Soupgiant was a little more drawn out but resulted from a similarly simple conversation — actually two simple conversations.</p><p>The first conversation was a few years ago when we both found ourselves out of work at the same time — the company we were both working at was going into a hiatus for a short period due to circumstances it&#8217;s not my place to go into here.</p><p>The second conversation was a couple of months ago in Josh&#8217;s lounge room. It was, in part, a wistful ‘<em>how &#8217;bout/what if</em>’ conversation. We spoke about the types of clients we&#8217;d like to go after, the type of work we&#8217;d like to do, and, the type of standards (high) we&#8217;d like to keep.</p><p>In the cold light of dawn, it stuck in both our minds, followed by the realisation that this was exactly what we should do. Within the week we were going over plans in a less wistful, much more serious manner. Talking about potential types of clients, we were struck that these sites were big, complicated sites.</p><p>Something very important had changed since the first conversation a number of years ago: at that time we&#8217;d worked on large sites for a single company, since then we&#8217;d both worked on exactly the kind of big sites we were talking about.</p><p>A short time later, we combined the word &#8216;soup&#8217; with &#8216;giant&#8217; and an agency was born.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/genesis-of-a-giant/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
