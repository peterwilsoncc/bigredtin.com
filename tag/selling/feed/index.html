href="http://www.aussiecon4.org.au/" title="AussieCon4 :: Home">AussieCon 4</a>, which is what <a
href="http://www.worldcon.org/" title="World Science Fiction Society / Worldcon [Official]">WorldCon</a> is called when it&#8217;s in Australia. WorldCon, for the uninitiated, is the World Science Fiction Convention. An annual event held at a different location somewhere in the world.</p><p>I was there in my capacity as one of the hosts of <a
href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">Boxcutters</a>. We were presenting and recording a panel. It was wonderful to meet a lot of people who already enjoyed the podcast and those who seemed interested in downloading it.</p><p>Actually, it was just wonderful to meet a lot of people.</p><p>My experience at <a
href="http://sxsw.com/" title="SXSW.com">SxSW</a> earlier this year was similar.</p><p>These conventions are not just about learning things. In fact, and let&#8217;s be honest here, they&#8217;re not really about learning things in panel sessions. They&#8217;re about being around like-minded people who might be interested in what you do and vice-versa. They&#8217;re about meeting people.</p><p>I went to a few &#8220;networking&#8221; evenings arranged by various &#8220;small business&#8221; groups back when I ran my first business a few years ago. There was too much pressure on those nights. People would be busy sussing other people out, swapping business cards and big-noting themselves. It felt really sleazy and desperate.</p><p>Networking is not about desperation. It&#8217;s just about meeting people. Some of them will be useful to you, some of them will find you useful, some will become actual friends and others will be forgotten.</p><p>The point is, though, that actual physical exposure is what is important. These are people who would not have heard of you if you hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>As a result of my time at AussieCon and SxSW, a lot more people have heard about Boxcutters and Soupgiant. In turn, I&#8217;ve been exposed to some podcasts, blogs and services myself that would never have come into my radar if I hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>It&#8217;s that simple point of mutual exposure that makes going to conferences and conventions worthwhile.</p><p>Also sometimes the parties can be really good.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Surprise.

As it turned out, we were unable to help with the task they had in mind. It was outside our area of expertise.</p><p>We may have been able to fudge it. Call us stupid, but we don&#8217;t think &#8216;fudging it&#8217; is the way to keep clients happy or maintain a low client turnover.</p><p>In this situation there are two options:</p><ol><li>Quote ludicrously high with the aim of missing out on the job. In the event the quote is accepted, the job can be outsourced with a tidy profit.</li><li>Tell the truth and decline the work</li></ol><p>We chose the latter option and used the opportunity to explain our areas of expertise. Selling the company, not the lie.</p><p>The natural fear is the potential client will storm out of the meeting, muttering obscenities under their breath.</p><p>What actually happens is the potential client realises their current project – or at least the original part of their current project – is a bad fit. They also realise they&#8217;re not dealing with sleazy salesmen willing to say anything to get a job and deal with the consequences later.</p><p>The second realisation sells a company. It&#8217;s something that can be used to convert a single project into a long term relationship.</p><p>Ludicrously high quoting, lies or fudging a task may get you more clients but getting clients isn&#8217;t the aim, the real aim is to keep them.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/honesty/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Beware the Amazing Bargain</title><link>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/</link> <comments>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 00:30:54 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content management systems]]></category> <category><![CDATA[planning]]></category> <category><![CDATA[pricing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[selling]]></category><guid

We talked about this while she dug her elbows into my forearm, persuading me to swap my mouse to my other hand.</p><p>My instant response, whenever somebody starts a conversation like this is to ask them why they want a website. At least that&#8217;s what it used to be. Apparently it&#8217;s bad business to tell people they don&#8217;t need what it is you&#8217;re selling. I held off for as long as I could. The conversation went something like this:</p><p>&#8220;How much would you charge for a basic website?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;For a website with original graphic design using a content management system you&#8217;re looking at a minimum of a few thousand dollars. It varies depending on what functionality you want on the site.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;OK. I called up this place that advertises on the radio. You know, &#8216;quick and simple websites from $495&#8242;?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve heard the ad.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;Well, it got really weird. They kept calling me and now they keep emailing me. I don&#8217;t really want to use them now. They&#8217;re too much like stalkers.&#8221;</p><p>We&#8217;ve all heard about how, when something sounds like too much of a bargain to be true, it probably is. This was definitely the case with &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243;. It turned out that for $495 you could have 3 pages. Extra pages cost more money and then there were the ongoing costs of hosting, a monthly cost of licensing their <abbr
title="content management system">CMS</abbr> and who knows what other hidden costs.</p><p>Let&#8217;s go back one step. They were charging <em>per page</em>. I remember people charging per page back in 1997, when sites were static. In fact, charging per page implies that they&#8217;re not using a CMS. So why then are they charging for CMS licensing?</p><p>So I told her what I thought she needed. She&#8217;s a physiotherapist and her business relies on her expertise in the area. A blog about physiotherapy, new techniques, stretching the right way, and avoiding injury could really help build her profile as an expert in the area.</p><p>&#8220;But a blog is a lot of work,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Not keeping it up-to-date can do as much damage to your reputation as maintaining the blog will improve it.&#8221;</p><p>She already works long hours and I knew she didn&#8217;t want <em>more</em> work. So finally I asked her what she thinks she can get from a website. I pointed out to her that her business is already at capacity. Not a single slot is left vacant all week.</p><p>It turns out that an organisation for a new technique she&#8217;s been accredited with wants to put a link to her website on their website. That&#8217;s all. In fact, that&#8217;s enough. The website could help her expand her business using this new technique.</p><p>It reminded me why I ask the question of potentially new clients. It means we&#8217;re going to build the right website for them <em>if they actually need something built</em>. If a client actually has a need for a new website then we can work towards that need. It helps us advise them on content, style and structure. These are all services that &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243; won&#8217;t provide.</p><p>The problem, though, is that businesses like those that advertise web production services at prices that seem too good to be true create an expectation in the market-place. They prey on those who don&#8217;t know enough about what they&#8217;re purchasing, lock them into systems where they end up paying more over time without ever actually giving them value for money.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
