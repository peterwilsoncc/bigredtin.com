isPermaLink="false">/?p=812</guid> <description><![CDATA[Networking is not about shoving your business cards in people's faces.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had the opportunity to co-present a panel at <a
href="http://www.aussiecon4.org.au/" title="AussieCon4 :: Home">AussieCon 4</a>, which is what <a
href="http://www.worldcon.org/" title="World Science Fiction Society / Worldcon [Official]">WorldCon</a> is called when it&#8217;s in Australia. WorldCon, for the uninitiated, is the World Science Fiction Convention. An annual event held at a different location somewhere in the world.</p><p>I was there in my capacity as one of the hosts of <a
href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">Boxcutters</a>. We were presenting and recording a panel. It was wonderful to meet a lot of people who already enjoyed the podcast and those who seemed interested in downloading it.</p><p>Actually, it was just wonderful to meet a lot of people.</p><p>My experience at <a
href="http://sxsw.com/" title="SXSW.com">SxSW</a> earlier this year was similar.</p><p>These conventions are not just about learning things. In fact, and let&#8217;s be honest here, they&#8217;re not really about learning things in panel sessions. They&#8217;re about being around like-minded people who might be interested in what you do and vice-versa. They&#8217;re about meeting people.</p><p>I went to a few &#8220;networking&#8221; evenings arranged by various &#8220;small business&#8221; groups back when I ran my first business a few years ago. There was too much pressure on those nights. People would be busy sussing other people out, swapping business cards and big-noting themselves. It felt really sleazy and desperate.</p><p>Networking is not about desperation. It&#8217;s just about meeting people. Some of them will be useful to you, some of them will find you useful, some will become actual friends and others will be forgotten.</p><p>The point is, though, that actual physical exposure is what is important. These are people who would not have heard of you if you hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>As a result of my time at AussieCon and SxSW, a lot more people have heard about Boxcutters and Soupgiant. In turn, I&#8217;ve been exposed to some podcasts, blogs and services myself that would never have come into my radar if I hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>It&#8217;s that simple point of mutual exposure that makes going to conferences and conventions worthwhile.</p><p>Also sometimes the parties can be really good.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Always Start with Content</title><link>/content-strategy/always-start-with-content/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/always-start-with-content/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:27:00 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[information architecture]]></category> <category><![CDATA[marketing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[search engines]]></category> <category><![CDATA[seo]]></category><guid

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" title="Search engine optimization - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Search Engine Optimisation</a> experts who will give you advice on how to possibly get to the top of search engine results pages. The truth is that there is no magic wand to wave to get you to the top of Google&#8217;s listings.</p><p><a
href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html" title="Corporate Information - Technology Overview">Google explains its search algorithms</a> and techniques used for pushing results to the tops of their pages. It&#8217;s clear, that there are so many different factors that go into their algorithms there is only one way to really get noticed: Earn It.</p><p>When first setting out to build the site, ask the following questions:</p><ul><li>Why do I need a website for my business?</li><li>What are my goals for the website?</li><li>Who is going to use the website?</li><li>What are people going to do once they&#8217;re there?</li></ul><p>You might just be building a website to tell people about your business. Is that enough? Should a website just replace an ad in the yellow pages? If so then you might need to invest in online advertising to get people to your site. <strong>The content</strong> is what will ultimately bring people to your website and if all you have is a photo of some of your products and an address and phone number, you will be overlooked.</p><p>Website content is a lot more than just an &#8220;About Us&#8221; page. You need to work out ways and reasons for other people to link to your site. A large part of how search engines measure the importance of your site is how many other sites link to yours and in what context.</p><p>What you need to concentrate on first, though, is building the content to make sure your business gets the most out of the website. <a
