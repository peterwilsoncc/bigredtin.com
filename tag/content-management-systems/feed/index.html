We talked about this while she dug her elbows into my forearm, persuading me to swap my mouse to my other hand.</p><p>My instant response, whenever somebody starts a conversation like this is to ask them why they want a website. At least that&#8217;s what it used to be. Apparently it&#8217;s bad business to tell people they don&#8217;t need what it is you&#8217;re selling. I held off for as long as I could. The conversation went something like this:</p><p>&#8220;How much would you charge for a basic website?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;For a website with original graphic design using a content management system you&#8217;re looking at a minimum of a few thousand dollars. It varies depending on what functionality you want on the site.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;OK. I called up this place that advertises on the radio. You know, &#8216;quick and simple websites from $495&#8242;?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve heard the ad.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;Well, it got really weird. They kept calling me and now they keep emailing me. I don&#8217;t really want to use them now. They&#8217;re too much like stalkers.&#8221;</p><p>We&#8217;ve all heard about how, when something sounds like too much of a bargain to be true, it probably is. This was definitely the case with &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243;. It turned out that for $495 you could have 3 pages. Extra pages cost more money and then there were the ongoing costs of hosting, a monthly cost of licensing their <abbr
title="content management system">CMS</abbr> and who knows what other hidden costs.</p><p>Let&#8217;s go back one step. They were charging <em>per page</em>. I remember people charging per page back in 1997, when sites were static. In fact, charging per page implies that they&#8217;re not using a CMS. So why then are they charging for CMS licensing?</p><p>So I told her what I thought she needed. She&#8217;s a physiotherapist and her business relies on her expertise in the area. A blog about physiotherapy, new techniques, stretching the right way, and avoiding injury could really help build her profile as an expert in the area.</p><p>&#8220;But a blog is a lot of work,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Not keeping it up-to-date can do as much damage to your reputation as maintaining the blog will improve it.&#8221;</p><p>She already works long hours and I knew she didn&#8217;t want <em>more</em> work. So finally I asked her what she thinks she can get from a website. I pointed out to her that her business is already at capacity. Not a single slot is left vacant all week.</p><p>It turns out that an organisation for a new technique she&#8217;s been accredited with wants to put a link to her website on their website. That&#8217;s all. In fact, that&#8217;s enough. The website could help her expand her business using this new technique.</p><p>It reminded me why I ask the question of potentially new clients. It means we&#8217;re going to build the right website for them <em>if they actually need something built</em>. If a client actually has a need for a new website then we can work towards that need. It helps us advise them on content, style and structure. These are all services that &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243; won&#8217;t provide.</p><p>The problem, though, is that businesses like those that advertise web production services at prices that seem too good to be true create an expectation in the market-place. They prey on those who don&#8217;t know enough about what they&#8217;re purchasing, lock them into systems where they end up paying more over time without ever actually giving them value for money.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
