href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=UFhlhCvQigkC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=hound+of+the+baskervilles&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=6BDrd2XvtZ&#038;sig=7gnwjXpUalRLTHxlTqvMbzKZV7w&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=aXkyTI2sO463cbHI2bgD&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=3&#038;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a> from the online store and started reading. I was an instant convert. I loved the experience and I loved the concept.</p><p>Until, that is , I found my way into Chapter 2 and there were vital passages missing from the text. It soiled my experience with the Kindle.</p><p>There are a number of lessons here. Obviously, there&#8217;s the whole <em>caveat emptor</em>, you get what you pay for scenario. A little bit of research would have shown me <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RX146XZB1IJWQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">this review</a> that tells me up-front what to expect:</p><blockquote><p> This edition is missing certain passages&#8230; Whenever there is a point in the story where a character reads out of a newspaper or other document, that passage is missing from this Kindle edition. Spend a dollar and get a different version.</p></blockquote><p>But the other lesson is more a question for thought. Why would Amazon keep the book in their store if it&#8217;s not what people are expecting? There is no obvious avenue to inform Amazon of the problem with the book and no way to ask them to remove the book so other people don&#8217;t fall into the same trap.</p><p>When building the user interface of an online store, there are many things to take into account. Feedback is vital for any business. Amazon and <a
href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a> have built empires with great customer service but customer service is about a lot more than just an attentive complaints department or a good returns policy.</p><p>Great customer service starts with the user interface. It&#8217;s the experience a customer has when they browse or purchase a product. A bad UI is like having a rude salesperson on the shop floor. A customer should be able to trust that the seller is looking out for them. There should be a way to bring issues of faulty products to the attention of the sellers.</p><p>Sometimes there are use-cases that just aren&#8217;t foreseen. But when they reveal themselves it&#8217;s important for an online store to be able to adapt.</p><p>So there are things that Amazon could have implemented to make my experience better. A roll-over information box that showed me the start of the most helpful review, for example, could have given me the information I needed to make my decision to purchase or not.</p><p>These are the small design things; the small usability things that we try to develop every day.</p><p>Recently I designed some wireframes for an online store. It&#8217;s hard. I had to balance the client&#8217;s budget with the limited information I had, the inclusion and prioritisation of use-cases, and a degree of future-proofing to allow for unforeseen developments.</p><p>There is a lot of information to include in an online store. There are lots of buttons and lots of icons to demand a customer&#8217;s attention. It&#8217;s important to remember, however, that customers want something very simple: They want to buy stuff and for it to behave as expected. Give them that and the rest will follow.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/design/designing-a-user-interface-with-caveat-emptor/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Expectations go both ways</title><link>/business/expectations-go-both-ways/</link> <comments>/business/expectations-go-both-ways/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2009 23:24:00 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[clients]]></category> <category><![CDATA[cooperation]]></category> <category><![CDATA[expectations]]></category> <category><![CDATA[quoting]]></category><guid

The price we gave the client and the amount they were expecting to pay were vastly different. Their budget was almost one-twentieth the cost of the application.</p><p>So who got it wrong and how did it end up so completely out of proportion?</p><p>It takes us a lot of work and time to come up with an accurate quote for a client. We put a lot of thought into every project and make sure we quote something that actually meets their requirements.</p><p>We learnt a valuable lesson: always ask a client for a ball-park figure for their budget before quoting. Maybe, if it makes them feel more comfortable, we could give them a minimum amount we expect it to cost before giving a detailed quote. Even if we told them a range that the price is likely to fall between the client would have been a lot more willing to tell us not to worry about it.</p><p>At a previous place of employ, my boss used to always talk about &#8220;managing the client&#8217;s expectations&#8221;. That&#8217;s impossible to do if their expectations aren&#8217;t actually stated.</p><p>Service businesses, like  ours, also have expectations of our clients. Part of the mindfulness of dealing with providers and clients alike is being honest about what is required from each party as early as possible.</p><p>Everybody&#8217;s time is valuable. The client could have found out immediately that they did not have the funds for what they wanted. That extra time could be used to think of other solutions for their needs.</p><p>We could have saved time and done work for other clients or on our ever increasing list of things we need to continue strengthening our fledgeling business.</p><p>Also, &#8220;managing the client&#8217;s expectations&#8221; is the wrong way to look at it. It sounds manipulative &ndash; probably because it is. Expectations, much like prices, are a matter of negotiation. If everybody involved has an understanding of their responsibilities and those of their partners in the project, even if it&#8217;s just the very start of the relationship, there is accountability on all sides and things will move forward much more smoothly.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/expectations-go-both-ways/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
