title="Quadra Hosting" href="/business/get-4-3-stars-for-customer-service/">Quadra Hosting</a>. Shortly after writing that post I&#8217;d relocated the Soupgiant sites to an American service provider.</p><p>Even though I&#8217;ve <a
title="done similar" href="/behind-the-websites/base-js-file/">done similar</a> <a
title="before" href="/behind-the-websites/partying-like-its-1999/">before</a>, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a compulsive liar. I promise. It&#8217;s because situations change and they can change quickly.</p><p>About the time we switched hosting providers, Soupgiant became responsible for hosting the <a
title="Boxcutters" href="http://boxcutters.net">Boxcutters</a> podcast. Each week Boxcutters releases an MP3 between 35 and 45 MB which is, in turn, downloaded at least 1000 times.</p><p>The maths is pretty simple, each week Boxcutters, alone, uses 35 GB or more of bandwidth. With our current host, <a
title="Linode" href="http://www.linode.com/?r=dbabace8cfcb30b5af6f5cbadfc5a628c2b6ae35">Linode</a>, we&#8217;re paying a little under $US60 for a VPS and 600 GB of bandwidth. To get the equivalent bandwidth in Australia, we would be charged at least ten times that amount.</p><p>(Yes, that&#8217;s an affiliate link. If you&#8217;d rather not follow an affiliate link, use this link to <a
title="Linode" href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>.)</p><p>It&#8217;s not entirely the fault of Australian hosts that they&#8217;re pricing themselves out of an international market. According to the OECD, retail bandwidth in Australia is <a
title="50% more expensive (link to spreadsheet)" href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/22/45/39575011.xls">50% more expensive</a> than in the US. It&#8217;s safe to conclude this is a reflection of wholesale pricing.</p><p>To state the obvious, hosting pricing has to follow the lead of bandwidth pricing. So if Australian web hosting providers are gouged, gouging of their customer must follow.</p><p>I&#8217;d love to host the Soupgiant websites in Australia, partly due to home-town pride but mostly because the 25,000 km (15,500 mi) round trip to California is pointless.</p><p>The simple fact is: Soupgiant can&#8217;t afford to host our sites locally, given that most of the bandwidth is used for a loss-making podcast.</p><p>Hosting the sites in the USA means we may break even some months but locally there&#8217;s no chance.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/why-we-host-on-american-servers/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
