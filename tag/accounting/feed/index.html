This is why we went with MYOB and how we're dealing with the headaches.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we sat down with our accountant to get some tips on starting up, we asked him what accounting software package we should use.</p><p>I had used the open source <a
href="http://gnucash.org/">GnuCash</a> before and I liked it. I felt like what we lost in localised specificity we gained by saving the hundreds of dollars charged by the local accounting package duopoly.</p><p>Peter had used <a
href="http://home.quicken.com.au/Pages/HomePage.aspx">Quicken</a> and wasn&#8217;t very happy with it. Similarly, in previous businesses, I&#8217;d used <a
href="http://myob.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1105078110482&amp;pagename=MYOB%2FPage%2FHomePageTemplate&amp;site=en_AU&amp;c=Page">MYOB</a> and thought it sported some of the worst user interface design I&#8217;ve ever seen in software.</p><p>The accountant told us that MYOB was the go. His logic was similar to mine but probably more financially sound. Forking out the $300 now would save us potentially thousands in accounting fees in the future. That made sense to us.<br

/> I believe that strongly in creating a brand identity as early as possible. When a client receives an invoice, there&#8217;s a statement one business makes to another about how much they care about their appearance.</p><p>The default invoice in MYOB is not going to cut it in the same way the default WordPress template or having an email address with Hotmail just makes a new business seem unprofessional.</p><p>MYOB&#8217;s default invoices are ugly. They are just text. Sometimes the text doesn&#8217;t fit inside the borders they themselves have created. Sometimes the text looks like it&#8217;s just floating on the page in some sort of information limbo.</p><p>Anybody who has ever tried to design an MYOB invoice template inside MYOB knows that it would be easier to tattoo your invoices onto a chicken and train that chicken to walk to your client and present itself.</p><p>The design interface is terrible. It&#8217;s unclear when if a change is going to affect one element or all of them. There&#8217;s also a whole lot of shouting &#8220;where did that thing just go?&#8221;</p><p>It turns out that MYOB is set up for those who like to print out invoices and send them via post. Also, they want to have pre-printed invoice templates that just need the information dumped on them.</p><p>Of course, not living in the 1980s, and happy to just deliver our invoices via an emailed PDF, we needed to work out a way around this. Apparently it&#8217;s easy to attach a background image to the invoice so we&#8217;re trying to design one that way.</p><p>The idea is that we print a pdf of an invoice, import that into Gimp and then add design elements in different layers. When we&#8217;re happy with what we have we remove the pdf layer, save the file as a png and upload it into MYOB as a background.</p><p>We&#8217;re still in the process of designing so we&#8217;ll let you know how it goes.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/myob-invoices-building-brand-identity/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
