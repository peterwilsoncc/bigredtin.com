After a couple of years of thinking about an answer, Josh might finally have one.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions we&#8217;re often asked by clients when doing an initial consultation is &#8220;what about twitter?&#8221; It goes along with &#8220;should we have a Facebook page?&#8221; and &#8220;how do I get MySpace friends?&#8221;</p><p>Social networking, of the web-based variety, is something that people will be writing books about for years to come. It&#8217;s as hot now as it was 3 years ago and 5 years ago. That is to say, it continues to be hot because there continue to be new social networks that become popular and die out and then become popular and then die out again.</p><p>The trick for a business is to be able to appropriately surf that wave of social network highs and lows and never put all eggs into a single basket.</p><p>There are big businesses that do great work on Twitter. Airlines like <a
href="http://twitter.com/virginblue">Virgin Blue</a> and <a
href="http://twitter.com/southwestair">Southwest</a> have a team dedicated to monitoring social websites to see what people are saying about them. So do telecommunications companies like <a
href="http://twitter.com/optus">Optus</a>.</p><p>For customers the advantage is that they can have a direct line to vent their frustrations. Shout out on Twitter about how outrageously incorrect your bill seems to be and you can not only have friends console you or also share their experiences, but there&#8217;s a fairly good chance someone from the company will be in touch to help you through your issue.</p><p>For companies the advantage is largely and expectedly the reverse. It&#8217;s easy to monitor exactly what people are saying about your company, your industry or your competitors. It&#8217;s also really easy to reach out to a customer and make them feel a little bit special by personally helping them with their problem.</p><p>Twitter, however, is not the place to try to influence customers or get them to change their habits. It is not as effective as an advertising campaign or a media release but it is a good place to see what people are saying about your latest ad campaign etc. Twitter for companies is more about measurement and accessibility than direct marketing and that&#8217;s important to remember.</p><p>Nobody likes to be spammed at. Nobody needs to get a direct message because they followed your company. People don&#8217;t hang around with Twitter because they enjoy being bombarded with irrelevant messages. They use the service because it helps them feel connected and part of a community. That&#8217;s important to remember because, while it might be hard to build up a good reputation on Twitter, it will only take minutes to be burnt and razed to the ground with no one around to sweep up your ashes.</p><p>A <a
href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tb/tb100809comic-con_and_hollyw">recent radio piece about Comic-Con</a> featured a genre film promoter talking about changing people&#8217;s opinions and excitement about a product. He told a story about going to Comic-Con to convince an audience of die-hard <em>Batman</em> fans that the, then, new movie (1989) would not be the camp 1960s <em>Batman</em> despite the involvement of the director of a <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/">Pee-Wee Herman film</a> and the guy from <em><a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085970/">Mr Mom</a></em>. Within minutes he managed to turn the audience from a booing mass to applauding fans excited with anticipation.</p><p>An opinion turn-around like that could never be achieved on Twitter. The value Twitter has, though, is that if something like that were to happen today, the people in that room would tweet about it and excitement about the product would spread exponentially and almost instantly</p><p>Twitter is the buzz. If our clients are on Twitter they are in a much better position to have their finger on the pulse and give them more information about the zeitgeist. They might not have a million followers but at the very least they&#8217;ll be able to gauge influence.</p><p>Twitter gives companies the ability to do something they&#8217;ve never done before. They have a direct link into their customers&#8217; thoughts and conversations. That&#8217;s a very powerful tool and it needs to be approached with patience and a lot of thought.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Understand What You&#8217;re Saying</title><link>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2010 03:39:28 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[advertising]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category> <category><![CDATA[copy-writing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[planning]]></category><guid

The right processes help avoid mistakes and lead you towards the audience you've always wanted.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes even the smallest amounts of content can completely undo the good work you are trying to do. In last month&#8217;s <em>Melbourne Magazine</em> there was a full-page advertisement for Mission Australia. It included information about what the charity does as far as helping families find affordable accommodation. Unfortunately it started with the following statement:</p><blockquote><p>In 2007-08, government funded shelters turned away 80% of Australian couples with children every day.</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s an asterisk at the end of that statement that says the statistic comes from the <a
href="http://www.aihw.gov.au/index.cfm">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a>. I can tell you now that it doesn&#8217;t.</p><p>What Mission Australia is saying is that more than 80% of Australian couples with children applied for shelter in government housing, implying they were in some way homeless.</p><p>In the Australian 2006 Census off-shoot, <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/2050.0Media%20Release12006?opendocument">&#8220;Counting the Homeless&#8221;, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, there were an estimated 105,000 homeless people in Australia.</p><p>This means that about <a
href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+australia">0.5% of the Australian population is homeless</a>.</p><p>In contrast, in the same census, there were about <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/9457b47091aa4b32ca257306000d56ea!OpenDocument">2.4 million couples with children in Australia</a>.</p><p>Yes, I&#8217;ve gone to great, even ridiculously exaggerated, efforts to show that some copywriter somewhere made a terrible mistake. They meant to say that of the Australian couples with children who applied for government funded shelter any given day, 80% were denied.*</p><p>This is a terrible mistake for Mission Australia. It is, in effect, misleading advertising that can affect how the charity is perceived in the market. Would a potential donor prefer to give money to a charity that makes outlandish claims? Someone could think that, rather than an error in copy-writing, this is an attempt by the organisation to make themselves sound even more important and necessary than they already are.</p><p>This may seem like an overly dramatic and pedantic argument. Of course people are going to understand that somebody made a mistake and didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly. That&#8217;s just the point, though. They didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly which means they weren&#8217;t fully aware of what they were publishing.</p><p>When I do consultations about content strategy, most of what I&#8217;m doing is trying to make my clients aware of what they&#8217;re publishing. It&#8217;s sometimes a long and complicated process because they&#8217;ve never thought about their business in that particular way before.</p><p>It&#8217;s very difficult to distil everything a business does into a single, simple yet accurately descriptive sentence. Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to mention a problem and then talk about solving that problem. That&#8217;s what Mission Australia does in their ad and it either makes them sound ignorant or like super heroes.</p><p>The first step, though, is always to work out what it is that a business does. Read it out loud, refine it and read it out loud again until it rings true. From there it&#8217;s easier to work out what the message is and read that out loud to see if it complements the description.</p><p>Every step of creating content for a website needs to be tied back to the original business description and message. You should be able to create a flow diagram to show exactly how it relates. Reading things aloud or tying things together through concept diagrams will be the barriers to letting misleading or inappropriate content hit the public sphere.</p><p>Not only will you avoid a potentially embarrassing situation, your organisation will be a lot better understood in the market place and a lot more likely to receive the response you were anticipating.</p><p>* It&#8217;s quite possible that that is a statistic from the AIHW. I tried to find it but I couldn&#8217;t so we&#8217;ll never know.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Craig McLachlan, Who Knew?</title><link>/business/craig-mclachlan-who-knew/</link> <comments>/business/craig-mclachlan-who-knew/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2009 00:23:00 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[advertising]]></category> <category><![CDATA[boxcutters]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Craig McLachlan]]></category> <category><![CDATA[media]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Neighbours]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Podcasting]]></category><guid

title="Boxcutters: an Australian Television Podcast" href="http://boxcutters.net/blog/2009/11/16/ep-203-craig-mclachlan-really/"><em>Boxcutters</em></a> featured Craig McLachlan as their guest and, in the process, providing a great example of the advantages of podcasting.</p><p>I firmly believe that it&#8217;s only in a podcast such an interview is possible</p><blockquote><p><em>Neighbours</em>, in Australia to this day, twenty [odd] years down the track, for me, poses the odd problem. The old guard of casting agents in Australia still don&#8217;t take you seriously.</p><p>Post <em>Neighbours</em> [a] small role in [My Husband, My Killer] had people [saying] &#8220;Crikey, Craig, who knew&#8221; We think the boy may be able to act.</p><p><em>Craig McLachlan</em></p></blockquote><p>On traditional media, it&#8217;s possible the guest would have been more guarded. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the case for McLachlan but certainly other guests have worried that they&#8217;ve caused <em>trouble</em> following a podcast interview.</p><p>As the interview went past its allotted time, Josh looked over the running sheet and started bumping other segments. 33 minutes later, all other segments had been bumped and it was time to finish the show. Having worked around the edges of mainstream media previously, I know this couldn&#8217;t happen; while a schedule isn&#8217;t set in concrete, it&#8217;s beginning to dry.</p><p>The key to this flexibility is a niche audience. While, by definition, the audience is small, it&#8217;s loyal and it&#8217;s interested. Without the boundaries of broadcast media, niche can take on a new meaning. Leo Laporte&#8217;s TWiT Network claims <a
title="2.6 million downloads" href="http://leoville.com/advertise">2.6 million downloads</a> a month — small compared to network television, but nothing to be sneezed at.</p><h4>Advertising to a Niche</h4><p>Advertising on traditional broadcast media, such as TV, is advertising with a scatter gun. Anyone could be watching: from a 34 year-old man to a 62 year-old grandmother. One will be more interested in the next generation iPhone than the other. Ratings will indicate which programme the 34 year-old is more likely to be watching but there will be a few grandmothers watching too and the network will charge for their eyes. How the television is being watched needs to be considered too: Are they watching while eating dinner? Reading with the sound down? Or have they left the room to make a coffee?</p><p>On a single subject podcast, every member of the audience is interested in the subject — so interested they&#8217;ve actively sought out a podcast. Using Boxcutters as an example, the audience may or may not be interested in the next generation iPhone, but they&#8217;d be interested in box sets of <em>the Wire</em>, <em>the West Wing</em>, <em>Deadwood</em>, and <em>Six Feet Under</em>.</p><p><em>If you need assistance setting up a podcast for your business, event, or group, Josh and Peter at Soupgiant <a
