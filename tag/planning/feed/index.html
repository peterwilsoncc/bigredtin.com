In the past I&#8217;ve literally spent days (if not weeks) looking for a good project tracking tool, or a group collaboration tool.</p><p>I&#8217;ve played with <a
href="http://lifehacker.com/5604687/google-halts-wave-development-shutting-it-down-by-end-of-year" title="Google Halts Wave Development, Shutting It Down By End of Year">Google Wave</a> (<abbr
title="Of Blessed Memory">OBM</abbr>) and toyed with <a
href="http://pbworks.com/" title="PBworks: Online Collaboration">PBWorks</a>. I tried wikis and intranets, I implemented networks and created complicated Excel spreadsheets. I have used at least five different time trackers and even more wireframing tools.</p><p>None of those things ever helped get the work completed quicker, more efficiently or better in any way.</p><p>I have largely learnt my lesson from this and mostly stick to the processes I know.</p><p>So, when a client recently asked me to create a software solution to a clearly inefficient business process I panicked and told them the first idea that came to mind. That idea was a complicated online spreadsheet and I am yet to implement it because I fear it&#8217;s just another distraction.</p><p>I&#8217;ve never found anything in web technologies as efficient or simple for managing workflow as a well-planned whiteboard.</p><p>My favourite whiteboard is the one in<cite><a
href="http://www.tv.com/show/110/summary.html" title="Homicide: Life on the Street on TV.com">Homicide: Life on the Streets</a></cite>. It sits up on the wall in the homicide office and features the names of the detectives and the cases they&#8217;re working on. An unsolved case is written in red marker and when it is solved it&#8217;s rewritten in black.</p><p>Red and black. That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s easy to look at the board and instantly see where everything is up to.</p><p>There are, however, two problems with a whiteboard:<br
/> 1) It is, to an extent, transient. There&#8217;s no permanent or historical record to refer to.<br
/> 2) There is no way for people to refer to it remotely. People might need to access the information while &#8220;on-site&#8221;.</p><p>These problems/requirements complicate the issue. It&#8217;s quite easy to have an elegantly simple solution to a simple problem but this is not a simple problem.</p><p>It&#8217;s a problem that many businesses face. The person who started the business has a lot of information in her head. She has also tracked jobs and written notes in a series of notebooks. It made perfect sense to her when the business was just her and her business partner but then her business grew. Over time more and more people needed to access that information.</p><p>I&#8217;ve worked for people who would ponder on a problem for a frustratingly long time. They would sit and reject idea after idea until they ran out of time to act. I&#8217;m often the opposite and I&#8217;ll jump on a solution, try it and then discard it a while later. Neither is good for business.</p><p>What I keep forgetting, though, is that the excellent whiteboard in <em>Homicide</em> probably wasn&#8217;t the first system they tried in that office filled with detectives. There must have been a time when the Baltimore police department didn&#8217;t have an elegantly simple solution for keeping score of investigations.</p><p>The key is to ask at every step, &#8220;Is this leading to a simpler way?&#8221; My client&#8217;s problem started as a simple process and was complicated over time. My job is <em>not</em> to make it more complicated.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/simplifying-can-complicate-things/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Beware the Amazing Bargain</title><link>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/</link> <comments>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 00:30:54 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content management systems]]></category> <category><![CDATA[planning]]></category> <category><![CDATA[pricing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[selling]]></category><guid

We talked about this while she dug her elbows into my forearm, persuading me to swap my mouse to my other hand.</p><p>My instant response, whenever somebody starts a conversation like this is to ask them why they want a website. At least that&#8217;s what it used to be. Apparently it&#8217;s bad business to tell people they don&#8217;t need what it is you&#8217;re selling. I held off for as long as I could. The conversation went something like this:</p><p>&#8220;How much would you charge for a basic website?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;For a website with original graphic design using a content management system you&#8217;re looking at a minimum of a few thousand dollars. It varies depending on what functionality you want on the site.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;OK. I called up this place that advertises on the radio. You know, &#8216;quick and simple websites from $495&#8242;?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve heard the ad.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;Well, it got really weird. They kept calling me and now they keep emailing me. I don&#8217;t really want to use them now. They&#8217;re too much like stalkers.&#8221;</p><p>We&#8217;ve all heard about how, when something sounds like too much of a bargain to be true, it probably is. This was definitely the case with &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243;. It turned out that for $495 you could have 3 pages. Extra pages cost more money and then there were the ongoing costs of hosting, a monthly cost of licensing their <abbr
title="content management system">CMS</abbr> and who knows what other hidden costs.</p><p>Let&#8217;s go back one step. They were charging <em>per page</em>. I remember people charging per page back in 1997, when sites were static. In fact, charging per page implies that they&#8217;re not using a CMS. So why then are they charging for CMS licensing?</p><p>So I told her what I thought she needed. She&#8217;s a physiotherapist and her business relies on her expertise in the area. A blog about physiotherapy, new techniques, stretching the right way, and avoiding injury could really help build her profile as an expert in the area.</p><p>&#8220;But a blog is a lot of work,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Not keeping it up-to-date can do as much damage to your reputation as maintaining the blog will improve it.&#8221;</p><p>She already works long hours and I knew she didn&#8217;t want <em>more</em> work. So finally I asked her what she thinks she can get from a website. I pointed out to her that her business is already at capacity. Not a single slot is left vacant all week.</p><p>It turns out that an organisation for a new technique she&#8217;s been accredited with wants to put a link to her website on their website. That&#8217;s all. In fact, that&#8217;s enough. The website could help her expand her business using this new technique.</p><p>It reminded me why I ask the question of potentially new clients. It means we&#8217;re going to build the right website for them <em>if they actually need something built</em>. If a client actually has a need for a new website then we can work towards that need. It helps us advise them on content, style and structure. These are all services that &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243; won&#8217;t provide.</p><p>The problem, though, is that businesses like those that advertise web production services at prices that seem too good to be true create an expectation in the market-place. They prey on those who don&#8217;t know enough about what they&#8217;re purchasing, lock them into systems where they end up paying more over time without ever actually giving them value for money.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Understand What You&#8217;re Saying</title><link>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2010 03:39:28 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[advertising]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category> <category><![CDATA[copy-writing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[planning]]></category><guid

The right processes help avoid mistakes and lead you towards the audience you've always wanted.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes even the smallest amounts of content can completely undo the good work you are trying to do. In last month&#8217;s <em>Melbourne Magazine</em> there was a full-page advertisement for Mission Australia. It included information about what the charity does as far as helping families find affordable accommodation. Unfortunately it started with the following statement:</p><blockquote><p>In 2007-08, government funded shelters turned away 80% of Australian couples with children every day.</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s an asterisk at the end of that statement that says the statistic comes from the <a
href="http://www.aihw.gov.au/index.cfm">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a>. I can tell you now that it doesn&#8217;t.</p><p>What Mission Australia is saying is that more than 80% of Australian couples with children applied for shelter in government housing, implying they were in some way homeless.</p><p>In the Australian 2006 Census off-shoot, <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/2050.0Media%20Release12006?opendocument">&#8220;Counting the Homeless&#8221;, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, there were an estimated 105,000 homeless people in Australia.</p><p>This means that about <a
href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+australia">0.5% of the Australian population is homeless</a>.</p><p>In contrast, in the same census, there were about <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/9457b47091aa4b32ca257306000d56ea!OpenDocument">2.4 million couples with children in Australia</a>.</p><p>Yes, I&#8217;ve gone to great, even ridiculously exaggerated, efforts to show that some copywriter somewhere made a terrible mistake. They meant to say that of the Australian couples with children who applied for government funded shelter any given day, 80% were denied.*</p><p>This is a terrible mistake for Mission Australia. It is, in effect, misleading advertising that can affect how the charity is perceived in the market. Would a potential donor prefer to give money to a charity that makes outlandish claims? Someone could think that, rather than an error in copy-writing, this is an attempt by the organisation to make themselves sound even more important and necessary than they already are.</p><p>This may seem like an overly dramatic and pedantic argument. Of course people are going to understand that somebody made a mistake and didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly. That&#8217;s just the point, though. They didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly which means they weren&#8217;t fully aware of what they were publishing.</p><p>When I do consultations about content strategy, most of what I&#8217;m doing is trying to make my clients aware of what they&#8217;re publishing. It&#8217;s sometimes a long and complicated process because they&#8217;ve never thought about their business in that particular way before.</p><p>It&#8217;s very difficult to distil everything a business does into a single, simple yet accurately descriptive sentence. Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to mention a problem and then talk about solving that problem. That&#8217;s what Mission Australia does in their ad and it either makes them sound ignorant or like super heroes.</p><p>The first step, though, is always to work out what it is that a business does. Read it out loud, refine it and read it out loud again until it rings true. From there it&#8217;s easier to work out what the message is and read that out loud to see if it complements the description.</p><p>Every step of creating content for a website needs to be tied back to the original business description and message. You should be able to create a flow diagram to show exactly how it relates. Reading things aloud or tying things together through concept diagrams will be the barriers to letting misleading or inappropriate content hit the public sphere.</p><p>Not only will you avoid a potentially embarrassing situation, your organisation will be a lot better understood in the market place and a lot more likely to receive the response you were anticipating.</p><p>* It&#8217;s quite possible that that is a statistic from the AIHW. I tried to find it but I couldn&#8217;t so we&#8217;ll never know.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
