As it turned out, we were unable to help with the task they had in mind. It was outside our area of expertise.</p><p>We may have been able to fudge it. Call us stupid, but we don&#8217;t think &#8216;fudging it&#8217; is the way to keep clients happy or maintain a low client turnover.</p><p>In this situation there are two options:</p><ol><li>Quote ludicrously high with the aim of missing out on the job. In the event the quote is accepted, the job can be outsourced with a tidy profit.</li><li>Tell the truth and decline the work</li></ol><p>We chose the latter option and used the opportunity to explain our areas of expertise. Selling the company, not the lie.</p><p>The natural fear is the potential client will storm out of the meeting, muttering obscenities under their breath.</p><p>What actually happens is the potential client realises their current project – or at least the original part of their current project – is a bad fit. They also realise they&#8217;re not dealing with sleazy salesmen willing to say anything to get a job and deal with the consequences later.</p><p>The second realisation sells a company. It&#8217;s something that can be used to convert a single project into a long term relationship.</p><p>Ludicrously high quoting, lies or fudging a task may get you more clients but getting clients isn&#8217;t the aim, the real aim is to keep them.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/honesty/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
