title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> from their list of supported browsers, usually, because of its <em>creative</em> interpretation of CSS standards, besides <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 7">IE7</abbr> is over a year old, and, <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 8">IE8</abbr> about to be released.</p><p>I&#8217;ve decided to continue support for <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> as it&#8217;s still in wide use &#8211; especially in corporate environments &#8211; and, I don&#8217;t think it needs to take a lot of work to develop for. I&#8217;ll say that again, I don&#8217;t think <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> is as bad it&#8217;s sometimes made out to be.</p><p><span
id="more-97"></span><abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> is the difficult child of the browser family &#8211; but like most difficult children, with the right tools it can be made to behave. <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 7">IE7</abbr> is better behaved than <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr>, but let&#8217;s not fool ourselves, it&#8217;s not the glowing example of a perfect browser, and requires hacks of its own.</p><h4>Standards Mode</h4><p>The best tool to reduce <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr>&#8216;s development time is to move the browser out of <a
title="Quirks Mode" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode">quirks mode</a> and into standards mode using an appropriate DOCTYPE, and, leaving off the XML declaration; I code in XHTML Strict, so my files begin:</p><pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;</code></pre><p>In standards mode the browser will inherit font styles within tables, use the W3C box model and vertical alignment defaults.</p><h4>Comments</h4><p>Create a standard comment format for your main CSS file which you can use when you know you&#8217;re going to have to write a hack for the <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> style sheet, such as <code>/*HACK ie6 ... */;</code> rather than flicking between your main and <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> style sheets during standards development, you can just search for hack comments during non-standards development.</p><pre><code>#someDiv {
min-height: 300px; /* HACK ie6 - height: 300px */
float: left; /* HACK ie6 - 3px jog (adjacent), zoom: 1 */
}</code></pre><h4>Surprises</h4><p>Once you&#8217;ve specified the DOCTYPE, and, repaired known hacks, <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr> is likely to surprise you with a few more creative problems, positioning, an extra few pixels here and there and other little tricks; but by ruling out the obvious in advanced, overall debugging will become less time consuming.</p><p>As I said above, <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 7">IE7</abbr> requires its own set of hacks. If browser specific debugging is required anyway, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s overly time consuming to continue support for <abbr
title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</abbr>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/not-dropping-ie6/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>7</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
