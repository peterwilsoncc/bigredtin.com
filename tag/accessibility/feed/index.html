I really tried to adopt the commonly advocated view that it's okay to require website visitors have JavaScript enabled but settled on a different option I could actually live with.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of my career as a web developer I&#8217;ve produced websites that work without JavaScript. For the JavaScript impaired the sites may be missing a minor visual feature or be a little clunky in places, but they work and the meaning remains clear. It doesn&#8217;t bother me that, sometimes, the cost of allowing for sites to load without JavaScript can mean missing out on the latest web fashion. I&#8217;m <a
title="Why I will not be dropping support for IE6" href="/behind-the-websites/not-dropping-ie6/">not a big fan of fashion</a>.</p><p>Currently, web development is undergoing some major transitions: the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> spec is being developed and <abbr>CSS3</abbr> is being implemented. The browser wars have returned, although this time around, it&#8217;s a battle to win developers&#8217; hearts by implementing the newest standards.</p><p>Now is the time for developers to re-evaluate their past practices; moving on from the old and embracing the new. I kept that ethos in mind when upgrading the Soupgiant WordPress base theme recently. Among other things we were porting it to <abbr>HTML5</abbr>.</p><p><span
id="more-967"></span></p><p>I really tried to adopt the commonly advocated view that it&#8217;s okay to require website visitors have JavaScript enabled. It was going very well, right up to the final hurdle when I couldn&#8217;t resist checking the site I was working on without JavaScript.</p><p>Everything looked fine in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. It was, predictably, Internet Explorer that threw a spanner in the works. For an artist&#8217;s impression, <a

href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">Remy Sharp&#8217;s <abbr>HTML5</abbr> enabling script</a> the site I was working on was unusable, if anything, it looked worse than the demo provided.</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t, in good faith, sell a website to a client that some visitors would find unstyled, half styled or difficult to follow in places. I didn&#8217;t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, the additional meaning provided by <abbr>HTML5</abbr> elements is just too great. <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc all provide meaning to a document that it&#8217;s difficult to justify going without.</p><p>It&#8217;s with the additional meaning in mind that I decided to go with &#8211; what I&#8217;ve dubbed &#8211; <abbr>HTML4.5</abbr>. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> provides the meaning while using traditional <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 tags as hooks for styling. It introduces a bit of tag soup, as instead of <code>&lt;article id="content"&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;</code> the code becomes <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;article&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p><p>The improvement to site I was working on was immediate, as you can see by <a
href="http://code.bigredtin.com/html5/html45.html">visiting the <abbr>html4.5</abbr> demo in IE8</a> (<a

class="wp-caption-text">HTML4.5 as seen in IE8</p></div><h4>I don&#8217;t care about tag soup</h4><p>If given the choice between an unusable website for some visitors or a little tag bloat, I&#8217;ll take the bloat any day of the week. In the demo the bloat adds an extra 14 bytes. On the home page for the site I was working on, it&#8217;s 40 bytes. I save plenty more than 40 bytes by minimising my JavaScript and <abbr>CSS</abbr> (a single key combo with the <a
href="http://www.experienceinternet.co.uk/software/yui-compressor-textmate-bundle/">YUI Compressor TextMate bundle</a>), so I&#8217;m not too concerned about the side effects.</p><p>A technically beautiful site is the ideal but if a portion of your visitors can&#8217;t use it, then the beauty isn&#8217;t even skin deep.

In the past I&#8217;ve placed these in the first menu on the page, usually positioned under the header.</p><p>According to the <a
title="fangs plugin for firefox" href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/projects/fangs/">fangs plugin</a>, the <a
title="JAWS" href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp">JAWS</a> screen reader reads the opening of <a
title="Soupgiant.com" href="http://soupgiant.com/">Soupgiant.com</a> as:</p><blockquote><p>Page has seven  headings and forty-three  links Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production  dash  Internet Explorer Heading level one Link Graphic Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production Heading level five Heat and Serve Combine  seventeen  years of web production experience, twenty  years of  television  and  radio experience,  put it all in a very large pot on a  gentle heat.  Stir regularly  and  serve. Soupgiant goes well with croutons  and  a  touch of parsley.List of five  items bullet <strong>This page link  Skip to Content</strong> bullet Link Home bullet Link About bullet Link Contact bullet Link Folio</p><p>- my emphasis</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a lot of content to get through, on every page of the site, before the Skip to Content link. It would be much better if the skip to content link were earlier on the site.</p><p>As the <abbr>HTML</abbr> title of the page is read out by JAWS, the best position would be before the in-page title. The opening content would then read as:</p><blockquote><p>Page has seven  headings and forty-three  links Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production  dash  Internet Explorer <strong>This page link Skip to Content</strong> Heading level one Link Graphic Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production</p><p>- again, the emphasis is mine</p></blockquote><p>That gives the JAWS user the title of the page and immediately allows them to skip to the page&#8217;s content. I don&#8217;t read the header of on every page of a site, nor should I expect screen reader users to.</p><p>I realise screen readers most likely have a feature to skip around the page relatively easily, regardless of how the page is set up but our aim should not be <em>relative</em> ease, our aim should be <em>absolute</em> ease.</p><p>As a result, we&#8217;ve decided to move the skip to content links on future sites to earlier in the page.</p><p>Sadly, this revelation came up as a result of what I consider to be a limitation of the WordPress 3.0+ function <code><a
title="wp_nav_menu" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu">wp_nav_menu</a></code>, the inability to add items at the start of the menu. I should have considered the accessibility implications much earlier. It serves as a reminder, to all web developers, that we should constantly review our practices and past decisions.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve recently changed something you&#8217;ve always done, <a

href="http://www.dynamicsitesolutions.com/css/filters/star-html/" title="* html ("Star HTML") CSS Hack">the star hacks</a> in YUI’s CSS. If we self-hosted the files they’d be moved into the CSS files with our other IE specific hacks and targeted with conditional comments. Our compromise is to load the files from Google’s server with the aim that our site will load faster. Either the user will already have the files in their browser cache, or the user will load the files from a closer, faster server on Google’s global network.</p><p>The W3C’s CSS validator also screams at us for using CSS3 browser extensions and rgba backgrounds. While the browser manufacturers are still trying out their implementations of the new specs, we’ve no choice but to use these for the time being. As they iron out their implementations and move them over to the specified properties we can remove these. CSS3 junkies could probably have skipped this paragraph.</p><h4>Justifying the invalid HTML</h4><p>This site uses xHTML. We’ve discussed using HTML5 but WordPress, which powers Big Red Tin, isn’t ready to drop the <code>/&gt;</code> from self closing tags. At this stage the HTML5 spec is too dynamic for our liking. Have a late afternoon snooze and the spec is likely to change during your siesta.*</p><p>Depending on your point of view, and even what you are coding, it is either fortunate or unfortunate that browsers don’t always follow specs to the letter. We’ve taken advantage of that to throw one of the biggest advantages of HTML5 into our xHTML. In our comments form, we’ve used HTML5 type attributes for two of our fields: <code>&lt;input type=”email” … /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input type=”url” … /&gt;</code>.</p><p>In browsers that do not support these types of inputs the type falls back to the standard of <code>type=”text”</code>. In browsers that do support input types of email and url, it prevents the user from entering an erroneous value. For users of the iPhone or iPad, a special keyboard is presented to make entering an email address or URL easier. In browsers that support the new HTML5 input types, the behaviour is identical regardless of the doc type.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">The iPhone displays different keyboards for HTML5 input types</p></div><p>It may be breaking some of the rules of standards. To me it&#8217;s not so much about standards as best practices and giving the user the best possible experience on a site, even if this means breaking the rules sometimes.</p><p>Don&#8217;t take that to mean that we&#8217;ll be reverting to table layouts, or insert code such as <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> into our xHTML. It&#8217;s bending the rules around the edges, which is no different to using vendor prefixes to make use of CSS3.</p><p>*Yes. I know this is an unfair characterisation. A lot of very important people, with very important lawyers, are working hard to change this.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/valid-isnt-best-practice/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
