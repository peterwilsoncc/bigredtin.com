For the JavaScript impaired the sites may be missing a minor visual feature or be a little clunky in places, but they work and the meaning remains clear.Â It doesn&#8217;t bother me that, sometimes, the cost of allowing for sites to load without JavaScript can mean missing out on the latest web fashion. I&#8217;m <a
title="Why I will not be dropping support for IE6" href="/behind-the-websites/not-dropping-ie6/">not a big fan of fashion</a>.</p><p>Currently, web development is undergoing some major transitions: the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> spec is being developed and <abbr>CSS3</abbr> is being implemented. The browser wars have returned, although this time around, it&#8217;s a battle to win developers&#8217; hearts by implementing the newest standards.</p><p>Now is the time for developers to re-evaluate their past practices; moving on from the old and embracing the new. I kept that ethos in mind when upgrading the Soupgiant WordPress base theme recently. Among other things we were porting it to <abbr>HTML5</abbr>.</p><p><span
id="more-967"></span></p><p>I really tried to adopt the commonly advocated view that it&#8217;s okay to require website visitors have JavaScript enabled. It was going very well, right up to the final hurdle when I couldn&#8217;t resist checking the site I was working on without JavaScript.</p><p>Everything looked fine in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. It was, predictably, Internet Explorer that threw a spanner in the works. For an artist&#8217;s impression, <a

I didn&#8217;t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, the additional meaning provided by <abbr>HTML5</abbr> elements is just too great. <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc all provide meaning to a document that it&#8217;s difficult to justify going without.</p><p>It&#8217;s with the additional meaning in mind that I decided to go with &#8211; what I&#8217;ve dubbed &#8211; <abbr>HTML4.5</abbr>. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> provides the meaning while using traditional <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 tags as hooks for styling. It introduces a bit of tag soup, as instead of <code>&lt;article id="content"&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;</code> the code becomes <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;article&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p><p>The improvement to site I was working on was immediate, as you can see by <a
href="http://code.bigredtin.com/html5/html45.html">visiting the <abbr>html4.5</abbr> demo in IE8</a> (<a

In the demo the bloat adds an extra 14 bytes. On the home page for the site I was working on, it&#8217;s 40 bytes. I save plenty more than 40 bytes by minimising my JavaScript and <abbr>CSS</abbr> (a single key combo with the <a

title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>&#8216;s support of <abbr
title="Cascading Style Sheets, Version 3">CSS3</abbr> selectors.</p><p>One of the disadvantages of using Selectivizr is it rules out using a <abbr
title="content distribution network ">CDN</abbr> for one&#8217;s style sheets. To quote their site:</p><blockquote><p>Style sheets MUST be hosted on the same domain as the page due to browser security restrictions. Likewise,  style sheets loaded using the <code>file:</code> protocol will not work.</p></blockquote><p>Normally, particularly for low traffic sites, this wouldn&#8217;t be of great concern. As we share style sheets across sites (both Big Red Tin &amp; <a
title="our Business site" href="http://soupgiant.com/">Soupgiant</a> use the same <abbr>CSS</abbr>) and use the <abbr>CDN</abbr> feature of <a
title="the WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> on our hosted WordPress sites, it could cause problems down the track.</p><p>After umming and ahhing for a couple of days, the following solution involving <a
title="defined on 'quircksmode'" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">conditional comments</a>, occurred to us:</p><pre>&lt;!--[if gte IE 9]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.example.com/styles.css" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;

&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;</pre><p>With a few lines of conditional comments, browsers supporting the relevant selectors natively can take advantage of the performance boost from a <abbr>CDN</abbr> while developers can take advantage of the advanced selector support provided by Selectivizr for IE&lt;9 users.</p><p>We&#8217;ve set up a quick <a
title="demonstration" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/selectivizr/">demonstration</a> in which three paragraphs have different <abbr
title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> roles &#8211; featured, unfeatured and neverfeatured &#8211; different styles are applied to each paragraph using [role=something]. The demo renders fully in: IE 6-9beta, Firefox (Win &amp; Mac), Chrome (Mac), Safari (Mac), and Opera (Mac).</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/selectivizr-with-css-on-a-cdn/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>HTML5 for Web Designers</title><link>/behind-the-websites/html5-for-web-designers-9/</link> <comments>/behind-the-websites/html5-for-web-designers-9/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2010 20:00:51 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Behind the Websites]]></category> <category><![CDATA[books]]></category> <category><![CDATA[html5]]></category> <category><![CDATA[reviews]]></category><guid

We still code in strict XHTML 1.0 for reasons that <a
href="/author/peter/" title="Peter Wilson  |  Big Red Tin">Peter</a> knows a lot better than I, but I suspect it has something to do with familiarity and knowing that it works. There&#8217;s a safety in that.</p><p>We believe very strongly in semantic mark-up and getting things working as much as possible in as many places. We believe in graceful degradation. I believe in closing tags once they&#8217;re opened and I didn&#8217;t like how HTML5 didn&#8217;t demand a trailing slash on stand alone elements. That just seemed like chaos.</p><p><a
href="http://adactio.com/" title="Adactio: Jeremy Keith">Jeremy Keith</a>&#8216;s new book, <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> is a no-nonsense 85 pages of the good and bad in the HTML5 specification. It explains how the spec is a lot more open and forgiving than previous specs. It also explains how much work was done to ensure better semantics than previous versions of HTML.</p><p>You&#8217;re probably thinking exactly what I was. How can any 85 page book tell me what I need to know about the largest HTML specification thus far? Is 85 pages even a book or is it more like an extended pamphlet? How can I take this seriously?</p><p>We bought the book largely because we trust the work <a
href="http://www.zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman Presents The Daily Report">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> does. This is the first book he has published under Happy Cog&#8217;s new <a
href="http://www.happycog.com/publish/abookapart/" title="A Book Apart: Happy Cog">A Book Apart</a> label. I thought that if anybody can get a writer to condense all the info I need into a short read, it&#8217;s Zeldman. But no pressure, JZ.</p><p>The important things it explains is how HTML5 can be used to include rich media on your websites, how it improves web forms (which got me really excited) and how it improves on semantics. And yes, it does actually explain them.</p><p>It explains these topics in enough detail that I could start using them today.</p><p>I want to keep learning and improving my knowledge of web-based coding. At the same time, <a
href="http://soupgiant.com/" title="Soupgiant | Web Production">I&#8217;m running a business now</a> as well as continuing to produce <a
href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">a weekly podcast</a> and trying to have a life. It&#8217;s hard to keep up with all the details of a new spec.</p><p>It turns out, all I ever wanted was an 85 page book that explained everything I needed to know and cut out all the stuff I&#8217;ll never use. I don&#8217;t need a beginner&#8217;s book but I also don&#8217;t want an expert&#8217;s tome. I want an executive summary and that&#8217;s exactly what this book is.

These files contain star hacks for IE targeting;</li><li>We use browser extensions to implement CSS rounded corners and rgba backgrounds;</li><li>Until I started writing this post, we styled a heading with <code>font-size: 145.4545<strong>%%</strong></code>.</li></ul><p>That last one was a typo, and has since been fixed.</p><h4>Justifying the invalid CSS</h4><p>Weâd prefer to avoid <a
href="http://www.dynamicsitesolutions.com/css/filters/star-html/" title="* html ("Star HTML") CSS Hack">the star hacks</a> in YUIâs CSS. If we self-hosted the files theyâd be moved into the CSS files with our other IE specific hacks and targeted with conditional comments. Our compromise is to load the files from Googleâs server with the aim that our site will load faster. Either the user will already have the files in their browser cache, or the user will load the files from a closer, faster server on Googleâs global network.</p><p>The W3Câs CSS validator also screams at us for using CSS3 browser extensions and rgba backgrounds. While the browser manufacturers are still trying out their implementations of the new specs, weâve no choice but to use these for the time being. As they iron out their implementations and move them over to the specified properties we can remove these. CSS3 junkies could probably have skipped this paragraph.</p><h4>Justifying the invalid HTML</h4><p>This site uses xHTML. Weâve discussed using HTML5 but WordPress, which powers Big Red Tin, isnât ready to drop the <code>/&gt;</code> from self closing tags. At this stage the HTML5 spec is too dynamic for our liking. Have a late afternoon snooze and the spec is likely to change during your siesta.*</p><p>Depending on your point of view, and even what you are coding, it is either fortunate or unfortunate that browsers donât always follow specs to the letter. Weâve taken advantage of that to throw one of the biggest advantages of HTML5 into our xHTML. In our comments form, weâve used HTML5 type attributes for two of our fields: <code>&lt;input type=âemailâ â¦ /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input type=âurlâ â¦ /&gt;</code>.</p><p>In browsers that do not support these types of inputs the type falls back to the standard of <code>type=âtextâ</code>. In browsers that do support input types of email and url, it prevents the user from entering an erroneous value. For users of the iPhone or iPad, a special keyboard is presented to make entering an email address or URL easier. In browsers that support the new HTML5 input types, the behaviour is identical regardless of the doc type.</p><div

class="wp-caption-text">The iPhone displays different keyboards for HTML5 input types</p></div><p>It may be breaking some of the rules of standards. To me it&#8217;s not so much about standards as best practices and giving the user the best possible experience on a site, even if this means breaking the rules sometimes.</p><p>Don&#8217;t take that to mean that we&#8217;ll be reverting to table layouts, or insert code such as <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> into our xHTML. It&#8217;s bending the rules around the edges, which is no different to using vendor prefixes to make use of CSS3.</p><p>*Yes. I know this is an unfair characterisation. A lot of very important people, with very important lawyers, are working hard to change this.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/valid-isnt-best-practice/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
