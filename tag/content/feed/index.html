In the past I&#8217;ve placed these in the first menu on the page, usually positioned under the header.</p><p>According to the <a
title="fangs plugin for firefox" href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/projects/fangs/">fangs plugin</a>, the <a
title="JAWS" href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp">JAWS</a> screen reader reads the opening of <a
title="Soupgiant.com" href="http://soupgiant.com/">Soupgiant.com</a> as:</p><blockquote><p>Page has seven  headings and forty-three  links Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production  dash  Internet Explorer Heading level one Link Graphic Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production Heading level five Heat and Serve Combine  seventeen  years of web production experience, twenty  years of  television  and  radio experience,  put it all in a very large pot on a  gentle heat.  Stir regularly  and  serve. Soupgiant goes well with croutons  and  a  touch of parsley.List of five  items bullet <strong>This page link  Skip to Content</strong> bullet Link Home bullet Link About bullet Link Contact bullet Link Folio</p><p>- my emphasis</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a lot of content to get through, on every page of the site, before the Skip to Content link. It would be much better if the skip to content link were earlier on the site.</p><p>As the <abbr>HTML</abbr> title of the page is read out by JAWS, the best position would be before the in-page title. The opening content would then read as:</p><blockquote><p>Page has seven  headings and forty-three  links Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production  dash  Internet Explorer <strong>This page link Skip to Content</strong> Heading level one Link Graphic Soupgiant   vertical bar  Web Production</p><p>- again, the emphasis is mine</p></blockquote><p>That gives the JAWS user the title of the page and immediately allows them to skip to the page&#8217;s content. I don&#8217;t read the header of on every page of a site, nor should I expect screen reader users to.</p><p>I realise screen readers most likely have a feature to skip around the page relatively easily, regardless of how the page is set up but our aim should not be <em>relative</em> ease, our aim should be <em>absolute</em> ease.</p><p>As a result, we&#8217;ve decided to move the skip to content links on future sites to earlier in the page.</p><p>Sadly, this revelation came up as a result of what I consider to be a limitation of the WordPress 3.0+ function <code><a
title="wp_nav_menu" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu">wp_nav_menu</a></code>, the inability to add items at the start of the menu. I should have considered the accessibility implications much earlier. It serves as a reminder, to all web developers, that we should constantly review our practices and past decisions.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve recently changed something you&#8217;ve always done, <a

When it comes to building a website, it's important to know what the client actually needs.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My physiotherapist wants to build a website for her business. We talked about this while she dug her elbows into my forearm, persuading me to swap my mouse to my other hand.</p><p>My instant response, whenever somebody starts a conversation like this is to ask them why they want a website. At least that&#8217;s what it used to be. Apparently it&#8217;s bad business to tell people they don&#8217;t need what it is you&#8217;re selling. I held off for as long as I could. The conversation went something like this:</p><p>&#8220;How much would you charge for a basic website?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;For a website with original graphic design using a content management system you&#8217;re looking at a minimum of a few thousand dollars. It varies depending on what functionality you want on the site.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;OK. I called up this place that advertises on the radio. You know, &#8216;quick and simple websites from $495&#8242;?&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve heard the ad.&#8221;<br
/> &#8220;Well, it got really weird. They kept calling me and now they keep emailing me. I don&#8217;t really want to use them now. They&#8217;re too much like stalkers.&#8221;</p><p>We&#8217;ve all heard about how, when something sounds like too much of a bargain to be true, it probably is. This was definitely the case with &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243;. It turned out that for $495 you could have 3 pages. Extra pages cost more money and then there were the ongoing costs of hosting, a monthly cost of licensing their <abbr
title="content management system">CMS</abbr> and who knows what other hidden costs.</p><p>Let&#8217;s go back one step. They were charging <em>per page</em>. I remember people charging per page back in 1997, when sites were static. In fact, charging per page implies that they&#8217;re not using a CMS. So why then are they charging for CMS licensing?</p><p>So I told her what I thought she needed. She&#8217;s a physiotherapist and her business relies on her expertise in the area. A blog about physiotherapy, new techniques, stretching the right way, and avoiding injury could really help build her profile as an expert in the area.</p><p>&#8220;But a blog is a lot of work,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Not keeping it up-to-date can do as much damage to your reputation as maintaining the blog will improve it.&#8221;</p><p>She already works long hours and I knew she didn&#8217;t want <em>more</em> work. So finally I asked her what she thinks she can get from a website. I pointed out to her that her business is already at capacity. Not a single slot is left vacant all week.</p><p>It turns out that an organisation for a new technique she&#8217;s been accredited with wants to put a link to her website on their website. That&#8217;s all. In fact, that&#8217;s enough. The website could help her expand her business using this new technique.</p><p>It reminded me why I ask the question of potentially new clients. It means we&#8217;re going to build the right website for them <em>if they actually need something built</em>. If a client actually has a need for a new website then we can work towards that need. It helps us advise them on content, style and structure. These are all services that &#8220;quick and simple websites from $495&#8243; won&#8217;t provide.</p><p>The problem, though, is that businesses like those that advertise web production services at prices that seem too good to be true create an expectation in the market-place. They prey on those who don&#8217;t know enough about what they&#8217;re purchasing, lock them into systems where they end up paying more over time without ever actually giving them value for money.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/beware-the-amazing-bargain/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Understand What You&#8217;re Saying</title><link>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2010 03:39:28 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[advertising]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category> <category><![CDATA[copy-writing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[planning]]></category><guid
isPermaLink="false">/?p=528</guid> <description><![CDATA[Sometimes even the smallest amounts of content can completely undo the good work you are trying to do. The right processes help avoid mistakes and lead you towards the audience you've always wanted.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes even the smallest amounts of content can completely undo the good work you are trying to do. In last month&#8217;s <em>Melbourne Magazine</em> there was a full-page advertisement for Mission Australia. It included information about what the charity does as far as helping families find affordable accommodation. Unfortunately it started with the following statement:</p><blockquote><p>In 2007-08, government funded shelters turned away 80% of Australian couples with children every day.</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s an asterisk at the end of that statement that says the statistic comes from the <a
href="http://www.aihw.gov.au/index.cfm">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a>. I can tell you now that it doesn&#8217;t.</p><p>What Mission Australia is saying is that more than 80% of Australian couples with children applied for shelter in government housing, implying they were in some way homeless.</p><p>In the Australian 2006 Census off-shoot, <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/2050.0Media%20Release12006?opendocument">&#8220;Counting the Homeless&#8221;, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, there were an estimated 105,000 homeless people in Australia.</p><p>This means that about <a
href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+australia">0.5% of the Australian population is homeless</a>.</p><p>In contrast, in the same census, there were about <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/9457b47091aa4b32ca257306000d56ea!OpenDocument">2.4 million couples with children in Australia</a>.</p><p>Yes, I&#8217;ve gone to great, even ridiculously exaggerated, efforts to show that some copywriter somewhere made a terrible mistake. They meant to say that of the Australian couples with children who applied for government funded shelter any given day, 80% were denied.*</p><p>This is a terrible mistake for Mission Australia. It is, in effect, misleading advertising that can affect how the charity is perceived in the market. Would a potential donor prefer to give money to a charity that makes outlandish claims? Someone could think that, rather than an error in copy-writing, this is an attempt by the organisation to make themselves sound even more important and necessary than they already are.</p><p>This may seem like an overly dramatic and pedantic argument. Of course people are going to understand that somebody made a mistake and didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly. That&#8217;s just the point, though. They didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly which means they weren&#8217;t fully aware of what they were publishing.</p><p>When I do consultations about content strategy, most of what I&#8217;m doing is trying to make my clients aware of what they&#8217;re publishing. It&#8217;s sometimes a long and complicated process because they&#8217;ve never thought about their business in that particular way before.</p><p>It&#8217;s very difficult to distil everything a business does into a single, simple yet accurately descriptive sentence. Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to mention a problem and then talk about solving that problem. That&#8217;s what Mission Australia does in their ad and it either makes them sound ignorant or like super heroes.</p><p>The first step, though, is always to work out what it is that a business does. Read it out loud, refine it and read it out loud again until it rings true. From there it&#8217;s easier to work out what the message is and read that out loud to see if it complements the description.</p><p>Every step of creating content for a website needs to be tied back to the original business description and message. You should be able to create a flow diagram to show exactly how it relates. Reading things aloud or tying things together through concept diagrams will be the barriers to letting misleading or inappropriate content hit the public sphere.</p><p>Not only will you avoid a potentially embarrassing situation, your organisation will be a lot better understood in the market place and a lot more likely to receive the response you were anticipating.</p><p>* It&#8217;s quite possible that that is a statistic from the AIHW. I tried to find it but I couldn&#8217;t so we&#8217;ll never know.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>The Right Content for the Right Audience</title><link>/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2010 07:26:59 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[blogging]]></category> <category><![CDATA[blogs]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category><guid

Particularly if a business relies on the expertise of its staff, a blog can really help that business build a reputation for being experts in that particular field.</p><p>What we&#8217;ve done in Soupgiant, however, is take the blog portion of our website and move it over here to Big Red Tin. The two sites still link to each other. There&#8217;s no doubt that the people in charge over here are also in charge over there. It&#8217;s one and the same.</p><p>We decided to separate the two because we didn&#8217;t want to disrupt any one audience.</p><p>Soupgiant.com is our sales website. It&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll put all our information about the products and services we offer. Customers will be able to see the work that we&#8217;ve done for other clients and can see if what we can do for them is actually what they want.</p><p>Big Red Tin, on the other hand, is just a blog. It gives us a chance to document every single part of our business, from bits of code to design concepts and also choices we make in running our business in the day to day.</p><p>Basically we hope that this will become a repository of information that can help people who encounter the same issues we have.</p><p>This is the first lesson of Content Strategy and it&#8217;s something we are taught all through school but still often manage to forget: Know your audience.</p><p>Websites have the added benefit of allowing our audiences to know us. So, in one sense we can work out the audience for a website by asking: What do we want our audience to know about us?</p><p>With Big Red Tin we&#8217;ve already answered that question earlier in this post: We want to share what we learn from the issues we encounter.</p><p>To do that, we&#8217;ve split this blog into four categories that we think detail all aspects of our business:</p><ul><li><strong><a
href="/behind-the-websites/">Behind the Websites</a></strong> details the work we do in coding websites and dealing with content management system (CMS).</li><li><strong><a
href="/business/">Business</a></strong> is about business decisions we&#8217;ve made or the general lessons we learn in running a business, either based on our own experiences or our observations of others.</li><li><strong><a
href="/content-strategy/">Content Strategy</a></strong> discusses the intricacies in honing the content of websites to achieve the greatest value from them. It might be about navigation or website accessibility or the general layout of information on the screen, but it also might be about words and how to use them.</li><li><strong><a
href="/design/">Design</a></strong> will bring together aspects of graphic design that we deal with. Buttons, images, colours, styles, legibility &ndash; basically everything that brings that all important first opinion will be dealt with under the &#8220;Design&#8221; banner.</li></ul><p>There might be people who are interested in all four of these categories but we hope splitting them out makes it easier for those only interested in one or two.</p><p>For more specific areas of discussion we have tags. There are many of these and you&#8217;ll see them at the bottom of each post. So, if you&#8217;re on a post about CSS3 and you want to know more, you can <a
href="/tag/css3/">see all our posts about CSS3</a>.</p><p>Big Red Tin is the result of a long process of planning, which is the only way to do content strategy correctly. We hope you enjoy what we do here and encourage you to share your experiences in the comments.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
