After a couple of years of thinking about an answer, Josh might finally have one.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions we&#8217;re often asked by clients when doing an initial consultation is &#8220;what about twitter?&#8221; It goes along with &#8220;should we have a Facebook page?&#8221; and &#8220;how do I get MySpace friends?&#8221;</p><p>Social networking, of the web-based variety, is something that people will be writing books about for years to come. It&#8217;s as hot now as it was 3 years ago and 5 years ago. That is to say, it continues to be hot because there continue to be new social networks that become popular and die out and then become popular and then die out again.</p><p>The trick for a business is to be able to appropriately surf that wave of social network highs and lows and never put all eggs into a single basket.</p><p>There are big businesses that do great work on Twitter. Airlines like <a
href="http://twitter.com/virginblue">Virgin Blue</a> and <a
href="http://twitter.com/southwestair">Southwest</a> have a team dedicated to monitoring social websites to see what people are saying about them. So do telecommunications companies like <a
href="http://twitter.com/optus">Optus</a>.</p><p>For customers the advantage is that they can have a direct line to vent their frustrations. Shout out on Twitter about how outrageously incorrect your bill seems to be and you can not only have friends console you or also share their experiences, but there&#8217;s a fairly good chance someone from the company will be in touch to help you through your issue.</p><p>For companies the advantage is largely and expectedly the reverse. It&#8217;s easy to monitor exactly what people are saying about your company, your industry or your competitors. It&#8217;s also really easy to reach out to a customer and make them feel a little bit special by personally helping them with their problem.</p><p>Twitter, however, is not the place to try to influence customers or get them to change their habits. It is not as effective as an advertising campaign or a media release but it is a good place to see what people are saying about your latest ad campaign etc. Twitter for companies is more about measurement and accessibility than direct marketing and that&#8217;s important to remember.</p><p>Nobody likes to be spammed at. Nobody needs to get a direct message because they followed your company. People don&#8217;t hang around with Twitter because they enjoy being bombarded with irrelevant messages. They use the service because it helps them feel connected and part of a community. That&#8217;s important to remember because, while it might be hard to build up a good reputation on Twitter, it will only take minutes to be burnt and razed to the ground with no one around to sweep up your ashes.</p><p>A <a
href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tb/tb100809comic-con_and_hollyw">recent radio piece about Comic-Con</a> featured a genre film promoter talking about changing people&#8217;s opinions and excitement about a product. He told a story about going to Comic-Con to convince an audience of die-hard <em>Batman</em> fans that the, then, new movie (1989) would not be the camp 1960s <em>Batman</em> despite the involvement of the director of a <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/">Pee-Wee Herman film</a> and the guy from <em><a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085970/">Mr Mom</a></em>. Within minutes he managed to turn the audience from a booing mass to applauding fans excited with anticipation.</p><p>An opinion turn-around like that could never be achieved on Twitter. The value Twitter has, though, is that if something like that were to happen today, the people in that room would tweet about it and excitement about the product would spread exponentially and almost instantly</p><p>Twitter is the buzz. If our clients are on Twitter they are in a much better position to have their finger on the pulse and give them more information about the zeitgeist. They might not have a million followers but at the very least they&#8217;ll be able to gauge influence.</p><p>Twitter gives companies the ability to do something they&#8217;ve never done before. They have a direct link into their customers&#8217; thoughts and conversations. That&#8217;s a very powerful tool and it needs to be approached with patience and a lot of thought.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/an-answer-to-the-twitter-question/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Blog Post: This Tweet Looks Unloved</title><link>/content-strategy/unloved-tweets/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/unloved-tweets/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2010 00:30:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[blogging]]></category> <category><![CDATA[blogs]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CoTweet]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Statistics]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Twitter]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Twitterfeed]]></category><guid

href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a> or a similar service. For the uninitiated, Twitterfeed converts a site&#8217;s RSS feed into tweets, allowing users to set and forget. The auto-tweets take the form &#8216;Blog Post: &lt;title&gt; &lt;short url&gt;&#8217; or similar.</p><p>When we launched Big Red Tin we didn&#8217;t set up Twitterfeed immediately.</p><p>With manual tweets we could customise the message to provide more details to Twitter users, one such tweet was:</p><blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve defined a new term: Web 1.5 <a
href="/design/web-1-5/">http://redt.in/b0KRut</a> ^pw</p><p>â€“ <a
href="http://twitter.com/bigredtin/status/16282703026">source: @bigredtin</a></p></blockquote><p>We had Twitterfeed set up at this blog&#8217;s old location and took the opportunity to compare click-throughs from manual tweets versus automated tweets.</p><p>Manual tweets had a substantially higher click-through rate than the automated tweets. I suspect the reason for this is two fold:</p><ul><li>With so many people using Twitterfeed type 	services, Twitter users have learnt to ignore tweets that appear 	auto-generated.</li><li>More information can be included in a manual tweet than might appear in an auto-tweet.</li></ul><p>Take the post we were linking to earlier, had we been using Twitterfeed the tweet would have been &#8216;Blog Post: Web 1.5 <a
href="/design/web-1-5/">http://redt.in/b0KRut</a>&#8216;. This provides so little information as to be next to useless. We would have ignored such a tweet out ourselves.</p><p>Many of the posts on this site are scheduled in advance, this allows us to publish at roughly the same time each week.</p><p>To schedule the associated tweets we use <a
href="http://cotweet.com/">CoTweet</a>. We have a couple of shared twitter accounts as it is, so CoTweet comes in handy for other purposes, but it&#8217;s the scheduling feature we use most of all.</p><p>If you use Twitterfeed yourself, try disabling it for a couple of weeks and manually tweet in its place. There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised when you compare your <a
href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> stats.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/unloved-tweets/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>1</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
