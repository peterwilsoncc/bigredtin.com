title="Soupgiant" href="http://soupgiant.com">Soupgiant</a>, included a couple of notes for our very patient designer, <a
title="Christa at Zepol" href="http://zepol.com.au">Christa at Zepol</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The frame of both sites will be pretty similar. We were thinking of different colour schemes [...] as a way of demarcating the two sites.</p><p>We haven&#8217;t got an exact style in mind, but something relaxed and modern without going over the top &#8211; <em>Web 1.5 if you like</em>.</p><p>— source: email to Zepol (emphasis added for this post)</p></blockquote><p>The rest of the brief detailed the <a
title="content separation" href="/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/">content separation</a> between Soupgiant and Big Red Tin. We wanted the design to come from the designer to fit the content, not from a committee to fit some other agenda.</p><p>In the context of this site&#8217;s design, the exact interpretation of Web 1.5 was left to Christa&#8217;s devices. As should the exact interpretation of any design brief.</p><p>To me, web 1.5 means something like: <strong>dump all the cliches of Web 2.0 design, at the same time keep the good bits</strong></p><p>&#8220;A good bit&#8221; may be a feature that is used frequently, such as oversized footers, because it adds something for users of the site. Cliches are those design tricks that add nothing but appear on every second web site, such as elements with faded backgrounds and rounded corners.</p><p>It strikes me, as a developer, it must be said that the definition of design is something similar: <strong>dump all the cliches and keep all the good bits</strong></p><p>Failing to do so risks rendering you a regurgitator, not a designer.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/design/web-1-5/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Always Start with Content</title><link>/content-strategy/always-start-with-content/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/always-start-with-content/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:27:00 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[information architecture]]></category> <category><![CDATA[marketing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[search engines]]></category> <category><![CDATA[seo]]></category><guid

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" title="Search engine optimization - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Search Engine Optimisation</a> experts who will give you advice on how to possibly get to the top of search engine results pages. The truth is that there is no magic wand to wave to get you to the top of Google&#8217;s listings.</p><p><a
href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html" title="Corporate Information - Technology Overview">Google explains its search algorithms</a> and techniques used for pushing results to the tops of their pages. It&#8217;s clear, that there are so many different factors that go into their algorithms there is only one way to really get noticed: Earn It.</p><p>When first setting out to build the site, ask the following questions:</p><ul><li>Why do I need a website for my business?</li><li>What are my goals for the website?</li><li>Who is going to use the website?</li><li>What are people going to do once they&#8217;re there?</li></ul><p>You might just be building a website to tell people about your business. Is that enough? Should a website just replace an ad in the yellow pages? If so then you might need to invest in online advertising to get people to your site. <strong>The content</strong> is what will ultimately bring people to your website and if all you have is a photo of some of your products and an address and phone number, you will be overlooked.</p><p>Website content is a lot more than just an &#8220;About Us&#8221; page. You need to work out ways and reasons for other people to link to your site. A large part of how search engines measure the importance of your site is how many other sites link to yours and in what context.</p><p>What you need to concentrate on first, though, is building the content to make sure your business gets the most out of the website. <a
