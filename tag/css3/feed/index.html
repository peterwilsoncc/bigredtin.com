title="Soupgiant" href="http://soupgiant.com">Soupgiant</a> base WordPress theme recently (among other things we were porting it to <abbr>HTML5</abbr>), we needed to decide which <a
title="shims and/or polyfills" href="http://remysharp.com/what-is-a-polyfill/">shims and/or polyfills</a> to use. We starterd with <a
title="on Remy Sharp's blog" href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">Remy Sharp&#8217;s HTML5 enabling script</a> but another to consider was <a
title="Selectivizr" href="http://selectivizr.com/">Selectivizr</a> to improve <abbr
title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>&#8216;s support of <abbr
title="Cascading Style Sheets, Version 3">CSS3</abbr> selectors.</p><p>One of the disadvantages of using Selectivizr is it rules out using a <abbr
title="content distribution network ">CDN</abbr> for one&#8217;s style sheets. To quote their site:</p><blockquote><p>Style sheets MUST be hosted on the same domain as the page due to browser security restrictions. Likewise,  style sheets loaded using the <code>file:</code> protocol will not work.</p></blockquote><p>Normally, particularly for low traffic sites, this wouldn&#8217;t be of great concern. As we share style sheets across sites (both Big Red Tin &amp; <a
title="our Business site" href="http://soupgiant.com/">Soupgiant</a> use the same <abbr>CSS</abbr>) and use the <abbr>CDN</abbr> feature of <a
title="the WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> on our hosted WordPress sites, it could cause problems down the track.</p><p>After umming and ahhing for a couple of days, the following solution involving <a
title="defined on 'quircksmode'" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">conditional comments</a>, occurred to us:</p><pre>&lt;!--[if gte IE 9]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.example.com/styles.css" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;

&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;</pre><p>With a few lines of conditional comments, browsers supporting the relevant selectors natively can take advantage of the performance boost from a <abbr>CDN</abbr> while developers can take advantage of the advanced selector support provided by Selectivizr for IE&lt;9 users.</p><p>We&#8217;ve set up a quick <a
title="demonstration" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/selectivizr/">demonstration</a> in which three paragraphs have different <abbr
title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> roles &#8211; featured, unfeatured and neverfeatured &#8211; different styles are applied to each paragraph using [role=something]. The demo renders fully in: IE 6-9beta, Firefox (Win &amp; Mac), Chrome (Mac), Safari (Mac), and Opera (Mac).</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/selectivizr-with-css-on-a-cdn/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Rounded Corners Everywhere</title><link>/behind-the-websites/rounded-corners-everywhere/</link> <comments>/behind-the-websites/rounded-corners-everywhere/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2010 02:34:42 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Behind the Websites]]></category> <category><![CDATA[border-radius]]></category> <category><![CDATA[browser support]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CSS]]></category> <category><![CDATA[CSS3]]></category> <category><![CDATA[rgba]]></category> <category><![CDATA[rounded corners]]></category><guid

title="Can I Use dot com" href="http://caniuse.com">caniuse.com</a>, I noticed how similar browser support for <a
title="border-radius" href="http://www.zenelements.com/blog/css3-border-radius-rounded-corners/">border-radius</a> and <a
title="rgba colours" href="http://24ways.org/2009/working-with-rgba-colour">rgba colours</a> is:</p><p><img
class="alignnone size-large wp-image-432" title="RGBA support Vs border-radius support" src="/files/2010/05/rgba-vs-border-radius-635x488.jpg" alt="RGBA support Vs border-radius support" width="635" height="488" /><br
/> – <a
title="source" href="http://caniuse.com/#agents=All&amp;eras=All&amp;cats=CSS3&amp;statuses=rec,pr,cr,wd,ietf">source</a><br
/> The striking similarity allows us to use both the old graphical and new css3 methods for rounded corners, giving us the same look in almost all browsers but without wasting the bandwidth of users with modern browsers.</p><p>At Big Red Tin, we&#8217;ve used this method for the top corners of the twitter bubble on the left, the relevant CSS is:</p><pre><code>.aktt_widget .aktt_tweets {
  background: #999
              url(10pxrounded-210w-24.png)
              no-repeat top center;

  background: rgba(153,153,153,1) none;

     -moz-border-radius: 10px; /* FF1+ */
  -webkit-border-radius: 10px; /* Saf3+, Chrome */
          border-radius: 10px; /* Opera 10.5, IE 9 */
}</code></pre><p>– <a
title="source" href="http://css.assets.sgiant.com/pressgiant/wp-content/themes/bigredtin/assets/child/c/screen/screen.css">source</a> (search for .aktt_widget .aktt_tweets)</p><p>Browsers that don&#8217;t support rgba colours use the first background call which includes an image to emulate rounded corners. Browsers that do support rgba use the second background call, which includes a fully opaque colour but no background image, for the most part these browser can interpret the border-radius calls that follow.</p><p>This method falls over in Opera 10.1, which displays a square border, and will fall over in IE9, which will interpret the border-radius call <em>and</em> download the image. I don&#8217;t see these couple of exceptions as a big problem, as browser support always involves catering to the majority.</p><p>Do you exploit a similar coincidence of browser support? <a

title="Everything You Know About CSS is Wrong!" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/csswrong1/"><em>Everything You Know About CSS Is Wrong!</em></a> At a little over 100 pages it&#8217;s a concise explanation of CSS tables and how they will &#8211; and an argument why they should &#8211; change the way in which web developers work.</p><p><em><abbr
title="Everything You Know About CSS is Wrong!">EYKACIW!</abbr></em> begins by explaining how today&#8217;s web developer has hacked CSS to do things it was never designed to do, in much the same way that we hacked HTML tables in the heady days of the 1990s; floats, faux columns, negative margins, positioning, and, several more tricks now used as a second nature all get dishonourable mentions.</p><p><span
id="more-57"></span></p><h4>I&#8217;m not so sure</h4><p><em><abbr
title="Everything You Know About CSS is Wrong!">EYKACIW!</abbr></em> points out that there is no CSS table equivalent of the col- and rowspan attributes in an HTML table, a method is detailed in the book to emulate these features with absolute positioning (also <a
title="Rowspans and Colspans in CSS Tables" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2008/09/09/rowspans-colspans-in-css-tables/">available on Kevin Yank&#8217;s Sitepoint blog</a>). The method detailed brings to mind the very hacks we&#8217;re being discouraged from using.</p><p>Another problem I can foresee is that CSS tables will increase, rather than decrease, the amount div bloat required for a typical layout; replacing <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;</code> in an old fashioned HTML table layout with <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;</code> &#8211; these otherwise redundant divs aren&#8217;t necessary for a basic layout, but seem to be inevitable for layouts requiring nested tables.</p><h4>Hold your horses (and other clich&#8217;s)</h4><p>These are my initial reactions to reading about CSS tables, in some ways it reminds me of my reaction &#8211; when learning CSS &#8211; to reading that the width of an element doesn&#8217;t include the padding or the border; my reaction back then was &#8216;but that&#8217;s stupid&#8217;, now it&#8217;s just second nature and the concept of including the padding and border is foreign.</p><p><em><abbr
title="Everything You Know About CSS is Wrong!">EYKACIW!</abbr></em> is about CSS tables, with an introduction to other CSS3 layout modules in the final chapter, modules that aren&#8217;t implemented in any browser &#8211; such as the grid positioning module and the template layout module &#8211; these modules excite me, CSS tables seem to require a different set of hacks, and &#8211; to paraphrase Regurgitator &#8211; I like your old hacks better than your new hacks.</p><p>It&#8217;s possible that the problem with <em>Everything You Know About CSS Is Wrong!</em> is that it was released too early; maybe it would have been better timed for a couple of years down the track when these new modules are in our browsers; regardless the book will cause a lot of discussion within the developer community about the direction in which CSS3 should go, and that&#8217;s only a good thing.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/behind-the-websites/review-everything-you-know-about-css-is-wrong/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
