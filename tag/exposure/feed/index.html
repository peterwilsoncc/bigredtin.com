href="http://www.aussiecon4.org.au/" title="AussieCon4 :: Home">AussieCon 4</a>, which is what <a
href="http://www.worldcon.org/" title="World Science Fiction Society / Worldcon [Official]">WorldCon</a> is called when it&#8217;s in Australia. WorldCon, for the uninitiated, is the World Science Fiction Convention. An annual event held at a different location somewhere in the world.</p><p>I was there in my capacity as one of the hosts of <a
href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">Boxcutters</a>. We were presenting and recording a panel. It was wonderful to meet a lot of people who already enjoyed the podcast and those who seemed interested in downloading it.</p><p>Actually, it was just wonderful to meet a lot of people.</p><p>My experience at <a
href="http://sxsw.com/" title="SXSW.com">SxSW</a> earlier this year was similar.</p><p>These conventions are not just about learning things. In fact, and let&#8217;s be honest here, they&#8217;re not really about learning things in panel sessions. They&#8217;re about being around like-minded people who might be interested in what you do and vice-versa. They&#8217;re about meeting people.</p><p>I went to a few &#8220;networking&#8221; evenings arranged by various &#8220;small business&#8221; groups back when I ran my first business a few years ago. There was too much pressure on those nights. People would be busy sussing other people out, swapping business cards and big-noting themselves. It felt really sleazy and desperate.</p><p>Networking is not about desperation. It&#8217;s just about meeting people. Some of them will be useful to you, some of them will find you useful, some will become actual friends and others will be forgotten.</p><p>The point is, though, that actual physical exposure is what is important. These are people who would not have heard of you if you hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>As a result of my time at AussieCon and SxSW, a lot more people have heard about Boxcutters and Soupgiant. In turn, I&#8217;ve been exposed to some podcasts, blogs and services myself that would never have come into my radar if I hadn&#8217;t been there.</p><p>It&#8217;s that simple point of mutual exposure that makes going to conferences and conventions worthwhile.</p><p>Also sometimes the parties can be really good.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/networking-is-the-new-networking/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
