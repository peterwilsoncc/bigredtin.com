Manual tweets had a substantially higher click-through rate than the automated tweets.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any blogger worth their salt knows of <a
href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a> or a similar service. For the uninitiated, Twitterfeed converts a site&#8217;s RSS feed into tweets, allowing users to set and forget. The auto-tweets take the form &#8216;Blog Post: &lt;title&gt; &lt;short url&gt;&#8217; or similar.</p><p>When we launched Big Red Tin we didn&#8217;t set up Twitterfeed immediately.</p><p>With manual tweets we could customise the message to provide more details to Twitter users, one such tweet was:</p><blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve defined a new term: Web 1.5 <a
href="/design/web-1-5/">http://redt.in/b0KRut</a> ^pw</p><p>â€“ <a
href="http://twitter.com/bigredtin/status/16282703026">source: @bigredtin</a></p></blockquote><p>We had Twitterfeed set up at this blog&#8217;s old location and took the opportunity to compare click-throughs from manual tweets versus automated tweets.</p><p>Manual tweets had a substantially higher click-through rate than the automated tweets. I suspect the reason for this is two fold:</p><ul><li>With so many people using Twitterfeed type 	services, Twitter users have learnt to ignore tweets that appear 	auto-generated.</li><li>More information can be included in a manual tweet than might appear in an auto-tweet.</li></ul><p>Take the post we were linking to earlier, had we been using Twitterfeed the tweet would have been &#8216;Blog Post: Web 1.5 <a
href="/design/web-1-5/">http://redt.in/b0KRut</a>&#8216;. This provides so little information as to be next to useless. We would have ignored such a tweet out ourselves.</p><p>Many of the posts on this site are scheduled in advance, this allows us to publish at roughly the same time each week.</p><p>To schedule the associated tweets we use <a
href="http://cotweet.com/">CoTweet</a>. We have a couple of shared twitter accounts as it is, so CoTweet comes in handy for other purposes, but it&#8217;s the scheduling feature we use most of all.</p><p>If you use Twitterfeed yourself, try disabling it for a couple of weeks and manually tweet in its place. There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised when you compare your <a
href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> stats.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/unloved-tweets/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>1</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Understand What You&#8217;re Saying</title><link>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2010 03:39:28 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[advertising]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category> <category><![CDATA[copy-writing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[planning]]></category><guid

The right processes help avoid mistakes and lead you towards the audience you've always wanted.]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes even the smallest amounts of content can completely undo the good work you are trying to do. In last month&#8217;s <em>Melbourne Magazine</em> there was a full-page advertisement for Mission Australia. It included information about what the charity does as far as helping families find affordable accommodation. Unfortunately it started with the following statement:</p><blockquote><p>In 2007-08, government funded shelters turned away 80% of Australian couples with children every day.</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s an asterisk at the end of that statement that says the statistic comes from the <a
href="http://www.aihw.gov.au/index.cfm">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare</a>. I can tell you now that it doesn&#8217;t.</p><p>What Mission Australia is saying is that more than 80% of Australian couples with children applied for shelter in government housing, implying they were in some way homeless.</p><p>In the Australian 2006 Census off-shoot, <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/2050.0Media%20Release12006?opendocument">&#8220;Counting the Homeless&#8221;, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, there were an estimated 105,000 homeless people in Australia.</p><p>This means that about <a
href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+australia">0.5% of the Australian population is homeless</a>.</p><p>In contrast, in the same census, there were about <a
href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/9457b47091aa4b32ca257306000d56ea!OpenDocument">2.4 million couples with children in Australia</a>.</p><p>Yes, I&#8217;ve gone to great, even ridiculously exaggerated, efforts to show that some copywriter somewhere made a terrible mistake. They meant to say that of the Australian couples with children who applied for government funded shelter any given day, 80% were denied.*</p><p>This is a terrible mistake for Mission Australia. It is, in effect, misleading advertising that can affect how the charity is perceived in the market. Would a potential donor prefer to give money to a charity that makes outlandish claims? Someone could think that, rather than an error in copy-writing, this is an attempt by the organisation to make themselves sound even more important and necessary than they already are.</p><p>This may seem like an overly dramatic and pedantic argument. Of course people are going to understand that somebody made a mistake and didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly. That&#8217;s just the point, though. They didn&#8217;t read through their copy properly which means they weren&#8217;t fully aware of what they were publishing.</p><p>When I do consultations about content strategy, most of what I&#8217;m doing is trying to make my clients aware of what they&#8217;re publishing. It&#8217;s sometimes a long and complicated process because they&#8217;ve never thought about their business in that particular way before.</p><p>It&#8217;s very difficult to distil everything a business does into a single, simple yet accurately descriptive sentence. Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to mention a problem and then talk about solving that problem. That&#8217;s what Mission Australia does in their ad and it either makes them sound ignorant or like super heroes.</p><p>The first step, though, is always to work out what it is that a business does. Read it out loud, refine it and read it out loud again until it rings true. From there it&#8217;s easier to work out what the message is and read that out loud to see if it complements the description.</p><p>Every step of creating content for a website needs to be tied back to the original business description and message. You should be able to create a flow diagram to show exactly how it relates. Reading things aloud or tying things together through concept diagrams will be the barriers to letting misleading or inappropriate content hit the public sphere.</p><p>Not only will you avoid a potentially embarrassing situation, your organisation will be a lot better understood in the market place and a lot more likely to receive the response you were anticipating.</p><p>* It&#8217;s quite possible that that is a statistic from the AIHW. I tried to find it but I couldn&#8217;t so we&#8217;ll never know.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/understand-what-youre-saying/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>The Right Content for the Right Audience</title><link>/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2010 07:26:59 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[blogging]]></category> <category><![CDATA[blogs]]></category> <category><![CDATA[content]]></category><guid

Particularly if a business relies on the expertise of its staff, a blog can really help that business build a reputation for being experts in that particular field.</p><p>What we&#8217;ve done in Soupgiant, however, is take the blog portion of our website and move it over here to Big Red Tin. The two sites still link to each other. There&#8217;s no doubt that the people in charge over here are also in charge over there. It&#8217;s one and the same.</p><p>We decided to separate the two because we didn&#8217;t want to disrupt any one audience.</p><p>Soupgiant.com is our sales website. It&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll put all our information about the products and services we offer. Customers will be able to see the work that we&#8217;ve done for other clients and can see if what we can do for them is actually what they want.</p><p>Big Red Tin, on the other hand, is just a blog. It gives us a chance to document every single part of our business, from bits of code to design concepts and also choices we make in running our business in the day to day.</p><p>Basically we hope that this will become a repository of information that can help people who encounter the same issues we have.</p><p>This is the first lesson of Content Strategy and it&#8217;s something we are taught all through school but still often manage to forget: Know your audience.</p><p>Websites have the added benefit of allowing our audiences to know us. So, in one sense we can work out the audience for a website by asking: What do we want our audience to know about us?</p><p>With Big Red Tin we&#8217;ve already answered that question earlier in this post: We want to share what we learn from the issues we encounter.</p><p>To do that, we&#8217;ve split this blog into four categories that we think detail all aspects of our business:</p><ul><li><strong><a
href="/behind-the-websites/">Behind the Websites</a></strong> details the work we do in coding websites and dealing with content management system (CMS).</li><li><strong><a
href="/business/">Business</a></strong> is about business decisions we&#8217;ve made or the general lessons we learn in running a business, either based on our own experiences or our observations of others.</li><li><strong><a
href="/content-strategy/">Content Strategy</a></strong> discusses the intricacies in honing the content of websites to achieve the greatest value from them. It might be about navigation or website accessibility or the general layout of information on the screen, but it also might be about words and how to use them.</li><li><strong><a
href="/design/">Design</a></strong> will bring together aspects of graphic design that we deal with. Buttons, images, colours, styles, legibility &ndash; basically everything that brings that all important first opinion will be dealt with under the &#8220;Design&#8221; banner.</li></ul><p>There might be people who are interested in all four of these categories but we hope splitting them out makes it easier for those only interested in one or two.</p><p>For more specific areas of discussion we have tags. There are many of these and you&#8217;ll see them at the bottom of each post. So, if you&#8217;re on a post about CSS3 and you want to know more, you can <a
href="/tag/css3/">see all our posts about CSS3</a>.</p><p>Big Red Tin is the result of a long process of planning, which is the only way to do content strategy correctly. We hope you enjoy what we do here and encourage you to share your experiences in the comments.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>10 Ways to Draw Traffic to Your Site</title><link>/content-strategy/10-ways-to-draw-traffic-to-your-site/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/10-ways-to-draw-traffic-to-your-site/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2009 00:23:00 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Peter Wilson</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[blogs]]></category> <category><![CDATA[buzzwords]]></category> <category><![CDATA[irony]]></category> <category><![CDATA[real time web]]></category> <category><![CDATA[top ten]]></category><guid

With that in mind, let me present ten ways to increase your visitor numbers.</p><h4>1. Top Ten Lists</h4><p>Create spurious top ten lists for an immediate spike in traffic. 24 hours later, you can go into Google Analytics and get a warm fuzzy feeling as your visitor numbers increase. It&#8217;s best to ignore bounce rate, and average time on site.</p><p>While your first time visitor numbers have increased, it&#8217;s unlikely that many of them will convert to regular visitors or subscribe to your RSS feed; but that was never the goal. The goal was to increase your visitor numbers: always handy for boardroom presentations.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/10-ways-to-draw-traffic-to-your-site/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>1</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>The &#8220;D&#8221; Word</title><link>/business/the-d-word/</link> <comments>/business/the-d-word/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2009 00:23:44 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Behind the Websites]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Design]]></category> <category><![CDATA[graphic design]]></category> <category><![CDATA[web design]]></category> <category><![CDATA[web production]]></category><guid

href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_designer">long and annoyingly complicated article about web design</a>, which begins:</p><blockquote><p>Web design is the skill of creating presentations of content (usually hypertext or hypermedia) that is delivered to an end-user through the World Wide Web, by way of a Web browser or other Web-enabled software like Internet television clients, microblogging clients and RSS readers.</p></blockquote><p>So, &#8216;creating presentations&#8217; you say. To call oneself a &#8216;Web Designer&#8217; is about as accurate as saying &#8216;I work with computers&#8217;.</p><blockquote><p>Saving files in HTML format is now a common feature in Office 2000 programs. In other words, you can save Word documents in HTML format and you can publish Excel workbooks as Web pages. <br
/><em>&#8211; taken from <a
href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA010548931033.aspx?pid=CH010485191033" title="Mircosoft Office 2000 Help">Opening and saving files in Office</a></em></p></blockquote><p>For years now we&#8217;ve been able to export Microsoft Word documents as HTML files. By Wikipedia&#8217;s definition, everybody everywhere who has ever created a word document could be called a &#8216;Web Designer&#8217;.</p><p>This topic came up recently because we had the phrase &#8216;web designer&#8217;, or something like it, on our <a
href="/about/">About</a> page. Meanwhile, on our portfolio page we had some, admittedly ambiguous, text about a specific piece of work we had done before Soupgiant was created.</p><p>This caused confusion. We received a demanding email from the graphic designers responsible for that work that we explain ourselves. Apparently their client saw our site and said &#8220;somebody&#8217;s taking credit for your design work&#8221;.</p><p>It took a little while before we worked out where the confusion. At no point did we intend to take credit for the design. As a matter of course we outsource all our graphic design because that is not our skill-set.</p><p>The common term is &#8216;Web Design&#8217;, but we don&#8217;t do design. Can we be &#8216;Web Engineers&#8217; without having an engineering degree? What about &#8216;Web Architects&#8217;?</p><p>We&#8217;ve decided to go with the term &#8216;Web Production&#8217; because what we do is more akin to a Producer&#8217;s role than anything else. We coordinate the production of websites and content. We can create, or organise the creation of, audio and video for podcasts. We can code but we also work with information architecture, testing, usability, and accessibility.</p><p>We bring together all the things that go into making a website. We stay up-to-date on technologies to ensure our clients get the best product possible for their budget. We coordinate, we define, we build, we code, we acquire, we provide, but we do not design. At least, we don&#8217;t do it well. We hire graphic designers to do that because that&#8217;s <em>their</em> area of expertise.</p><p><em>Our</em> area of expertise is creating excellent, accessible and functional websites using every resource we have at our disposal.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/business/the-d-word/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Always Start with Content</title><link>/content-strategy/always-start-with-content/</link> <comments>/content-strategy/always-start-with-content/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:27:00 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Josh Kinal</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Content Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[information architecture]]></category> <category><![CDATA[marketing]]></category> <category><![CDATA[search engines]]></category> <category><![CDATA[seo]]></category><guid

href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html" title="Corporate Information - Technology Overview">Google explains its search algorithms</a> and techniques used for pushing results to the tops of their pages. It&#8217;s clear, that there are so many different factors that go into their algorithms there is only one way to really get noticed: Earn It.</p><p>When first setting out to build the site, ask the following questions:</p><ul><li>Why do I need a website for my business?</li><li>What are my goals for the website?</li><li>Who is going to use the website?</li><li>What are people going to do once they&#8217;re there?</li></ul><p>You might just be building a website to tell people about your business. Is that enough? Should a website just replace an ad in the yellow pages? If so then you might need to invest in online advertising to get people to your site. <strong>The content</strong> is what will ultimately bring people to your website and if all you have is a photo of some of your products and an address and phone number, you will be overlooked.</p><p>Website content is a lot more than just an &#8220;About Us&#8221; page. You need to work out ways and reasons for other people to link to your site. A large part of how search engines measure the importance of your site is how many other sites link to yours and in what context.</p><p>What you need to concentrate on first, though, is building the content to make sure your business gets the most out of the website. <a

href="http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/galleries/inspirationalnavigation-menus/">50 Gorgeous Navigation Menus</a> I started thinking about what made these menus so nice to use.</p><p>Sure the designs on these menus were nice but there was something else. Something that made them really simple. Almost none of them have drop-down secondary menus.</p><p>The drop-down secondary menu is a killer when it comes to usability. So often the menu will disappear while navigating towards it, for example.</p><p>As far as accessibility goes it also causes problems. The main navigation menu for a site often appears above the content. This makes sense. But if there are 5 main menu items and each item has 4 sub-items, now there are 20 items for a screen reader to get through before getting to the content. If someone is navigating by keyboard instead of mouse, what are the rules for where each menu item appears in the tab list?</p><p>Do you need all of those lists of what&#8217;s on the site at the top of the screen? Isn&#8217;t that what you&#8217;ve got a sitemap for in the first place?</p><p>The difficult task is to still relay the information that can be accessed in each part of the site.</p><p>Remember when department stores had elevator operators? You might only know of them from the opening credits of <em>Are You Being Served?</em> but they really existed.</p><p>The elevator operator would stop the elevator at each floor and announce what was on that floor. Nobody expected to be able to go into a department store and access men&#8217;s underwear instantly. They knew they had to go through the process of entering the store, going to the elevator, go up to the third floor and walk through slacks, shirts and ties before they got there. And they knew that all of that was available on the third floor because the elevator operator told them so.</p><p>So my suggestion is to include a little bit of text underneath the menu, like the area where the submenu currently is on <a
href="http://designsensory.com/">DesignSensory</a>&#8216;s site, but instead of having a submenu there, just have a bit of explanatory text. For DesignSensory&#8217;s &#8220;Services&#8221; menu item it could be something like: Information about all our web, print and branding design services.</p><p>As long as a user knows that they are heading in the right direction, they&#8217;ll follow the path. They don&#8217;t need to be able to magically appear at their destination and don&#8217;t really expect to. Just give them as much information as they need to take the next step.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>/content-strategy/the-department-store-elevator-model-for-site-navigation/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
