		<description><![CDATA[A good narrative of the WordPress Theme Unit Test Data with a slight leaning to your design ideals. A couple of items you might consider:

a:active - based on anchor tags using `link` (default?), `visited`, `focus`, `hover` and `active`{}
personally I would not use the &#039;featured image&#039; functionality of the post_thumbnail in the single (post) template if it is also used in the standard templates that list posts (index, categories, tags, etc.). That is to say I would consider it as the designer&#039;s prerogative to do; but it could work well if placed aesthetically.

... otherwise, I like it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love WordPress. But I hate Widgets! Does everybody really still use them? I tend to find myself hardcoding elements in (instead). This is largely because I use WordPress MultiSite and hate having to configure widgets for *every* site via WP Admin. I&#039;d rather work in Coda than WP Admin.

Is this wrong BRT? Please advise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Peter, great post and great of you to share it. Widgets can include social buttons/plug-ins too, can&#039;t they, that can be made to look quite different, or stylised to suit the theme?]]></description>
