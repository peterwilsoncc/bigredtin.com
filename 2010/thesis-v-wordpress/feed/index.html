Your example may seem reasonable as that piece of code would look pretty much the same in most any similar platform.

Usage of these very likely constitute a derivative work. Unfortunately, GPL is not worded perfectly and seemed to have compiled languages in mind. There may still be a loophole, who knows. The intention of WP was very clear, however. To use some loophole (if there is one) to avoid one&#039;s responsibility to the community is just shameful.http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/This debate may now be moot as allegedly hundreds of lines of code copied and pasted from WP core have been found in Thesis.

No one will argue that the CSS/JS must be GPL unless they are derived from a GPL theme. Perhaps Mullenweg may even concede some of the more basic html theme files are also not derivative works.Thesis, however, is much more than basic theme. It extends WordPress classes and interacts heavily with the WP API in ways that many themes don&#039;t. The consensus among the legal community (well, those that deal with the GPL) is that WP themes are in fact derivative works given the design of the theme system.The gray area is whether not interacting with the WP api constitutes a derivative work. I&#039;m torn on this aspect of the issue. However, while I have not seen the Thesis code, someone did post a screenshot of a piece of code in Thesis that extends a WP class. That piece is very obviously a derivative work.Pearson&#039;s incoherent arguments do little to help his cause. He is foolish to alienate the same community that pays his bills. That said, both men have shown poor form in handling the issue.</description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think you have missed an important distinction.
