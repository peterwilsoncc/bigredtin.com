				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A client asked us to put together a list of every design element required in a WordPress theme but it&#8217;s the sort of thing we think we should share.</p>
<p>When producing a theme, we try not to limit the website owner&#8217;s options within the WordPress Dashboard. The owner may wish to enable an option down the track and be disappointed if they can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The downside for the designer and developer is they may put in work for elements that are never used. The upside is happy clients and return business.</p>
<p>Like most things web, the site&#8217;s purpose will dictate that some things just aren&#8217;t feasible. Consider this as a series of guidelines that you can adapt for your purposes.</p>
<p><span id="more-1286"></span>
<p>This is a giant list of everything we could think of. It makes the task of designing for WordPress look a lot more daunting than it actually is. The <a href="http://wpthemetestdata.wordpress.com/">theme test unit</a> contains posts with every type of content listed below.</p>
<p><em>For the purposes of this post, we focused on our <a href="/framework/">internal WordPress framework</a>. </em></p>
<h4>The website basics</h4>
<p>The frame of the website includes the header, footer and any sidebars for website owners to add widgets. The frame may change on various pages throughout the site.</p>
<p>Some typical items that need to be designed for the site are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menus, including hover states and any drop downs or mega menus, if applicable</li>
<li>Headings and sub headings: HTML can have up to six levels of headings and sub headings. To keep code semantic in our framework, it allows
<ul>
<li>5 levels of headings within a page (with the page title being the top level)</li>
<li>4 levels of headings within a post (on archive pages, the post title is a second level heading)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Form input fields, including
<ul>
<li>label placement</li>
<li>error message placement</li>
<li>focus states (when the user&#8217;s cursor is in the input)</li>
<li>submit buttons
<ul>
<li>hover states</li>
<li>focus states</li>
<li>active states (when the button is clicked)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an example of a typical layout can be found on our CSS framework&#8217;s <a href="http://www.minimumpage.com/forms.html">form demo page</a> (hit the submit button to view error messages).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>link colours
<ul>
<li>default</li>
<li>visited (if different from default)</li>
<li>hover state</li>
<li>focus state (for users navigating the page via keyboard)<br />As <a href="/2011/maintaining-link-focus/">mentioned in a recent post</a>, we tend to reverse the foreground and background colours for the focus state. </li>
<li>active state (when the link is being clicked, frequently the same as hover state)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Footer, typically containing
<ul>
<li>links to website policies</li>
<li>declaration of copyright,</li>
<li>links to main pages or a site map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Widgets</h4>
<p>Widgets are the various elements that appear in the sidebar, such as recent posts.</p>
<p>Each widget has a title and the contents described below</p>
<ul>
<li>List Widgets<br />Most widgets are a list of links. Commonly these are styled in the same fashion but, if the design demands it, they can be made to look quite different.
<ul>
<li> Archives of months/categories
<ul>
<li>Option: Display as drop down</li>
<li>Option: Show or hide post count</li>
<li>Option for categories: show hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Links/blog roll
<ul>
<li>Option: show link image (if no image, title is displayed)</li>
<li>Option: show link title</li>
<li>Option: show link description</li>
<li>Option: show link rating</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pages/custom menu, shown as hierarchy. Options do not affect design.</li>
<li>Recent post titles
<ul>
<li>Option: number of posts to display</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meta, links to site&#8217;s admin, RSS feed and similar</li>
<li>RSS Feed, can also be used to show recent posts. Shows title and an extract from the post.
<ul>
<li>Option: number to display</li>
<li>Option: display post author</li>
<li>Option: display post date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recent Comments.<br />Actually two links per list item; one to the comment and one to the commenter&#8217;s webpage.
<ul>
<li> Option: Number of comments to display</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other widgets
<ul>
<li>Search form, includes input and a submit button</li>
<li>Text widget, can include any HTML</li>
<li>Calendar: one month with links to dates on which there were posts</li>
<li>Tag cloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugins can be used to add other widgets to your page, for example a mailing list subscription form.</p>
<h4>Archives and Search Results</h4>
<p>WordPress includes the following archives of posts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Main archive &#8211; archive of posts from all categories by all authors</li>
<li>Date based archives (by year, month and day)</li>
<li>Category archives</li>
<li>Tag archives</li>
<li>Author archives </li>
<li>Search results by search term</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for the designer to include a description or author bio on the page. If you add this, you need to allow for the element to be removed if no description/bio is defined.</p>
<p>The archives are a list of posts, while the designer may remove them, they typically include</p>
<ul>
<li>title,</li>
<li>category,</li>
<li>tags (if added by website owner),</li>
<li>author,</li>
<li>number of comments,</li>
<li>date of post,</li>
<li>a short excerpt, the beginning or full text of the post</li>
<li>a &#8216;read more&#8217; link</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, links to older and newer posts are displayed.</p>
<p>Search results display both pages and posts containing the search term in their title, excerpt or content.</p>
<h4>Single Posts</h4>
<p>Single posts typically display</p>
<ul>
<li>a feature image or thumbnail (if enabled by the designer)</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>category</li>
<li>tags (if defined by website owner)</li>
<li>author</li>
<li>comments (if enabled)</li>
<li>comment form (if open)</li>
<li>date of post</li>
<li>full text of the post</li>
<li>links to the next &amp; previous posts</li>
<li>links to the next and previous page of comments (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>it is also possible to display a variety of information about the author if it has been defined.</p>
<p>Some plugins add extra content to the contents of this page. Designing for the gazillions of plugins available is impossible so discussing plugins with your client upfront will be helpful.</p>
<p>WordPress supports <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats">post formats</a> which can be used to alter the display for the post depending on it&#8217;s content. The theme designer can choose to enable none, some or all of these. Possible post formats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>standard</li>
<li>aside</li>
<li>gallery</li>
<li>link</li>
<li>image</li>
<li>quote</li>
<li>status</li>
<li>video</li>
<li>audio</li>
<li>chat</li>
</ul>
<h4>Single pages</h4>
<p>WordPress allows multiple page templates to be included within a theme, common templates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A standard page layout (required)</li>
<li>A home page</li>
<li>Special purpose landing pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Pages typically display</p>
<ul>
<li>a feature image or thumbnail (if enabled by the designer)</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>comments (if enabled)</li>
<li>comments form (if open)</li>
<li>full text of the page</li>
<li>links to the next &amp; previous pages of comments (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Attachment pages</h4>
<p>An attachment page is linked to from an image or other media file.</p>
<ul>
<li>The full sized image, or a link to the media file</li>
<li>A caption</li>
<li>the next/previous attachment &#8211; if applicable.</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>date uploaded</li>
<li>comments (if enabled)</li>
<li>links to next / previous page of comments (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Post and page content</h4>
<p>The WordPress visual editor allows website owners to add numerous items to their post content, including</p>
<ul>
<li>bulleted and numbers lists,</li>
<li>block quotes </li>
<li>left, right, centre or justified alignment of text,</li>
<li>links</li>
<li>headings &amp; subheadings &#8211; up to five levels in our framework</li>
<li>images (left, right or centre aligned)</li>
<li>images with captions  (left, right or centre aligned)</li>
<li>video &#8211; either uploaded or embedding a youtube video.</li>
<li>audio &#8211; either uploaded or embedding from elsewhere</li>
<li>links to next/previous pages (if the page/post is split across pages)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the website owner knows HTML, they can add other items using the HTML editor.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://wpthemetestdata.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/layout-test/">layout test post</a> on the theme test data page contains everything the website owner can add.</p>
<p>If the theme author enables it, each post and page may include a featured image/thumbnail. This may be displayed wherever post content appears.</p>
<p>Pull out quotes and other decretive elements can be added at the theme designers desecration.</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Comments are generally displayed in the same manner on both pages and posts. WordPress allows for comments to be</p>
<ul>
<li>Paginated </li>
<li>Nested<br />By default WordPress allows comments to be nested up to ten levels deep. As the theme designer you can disable this or limit it to a lower number.<br />We tend to limit it three or four levels deep.</li>
<li>display avatars or not.<br />As these are enabled and disabled in the dashboard, it is important for the comment design to allow for both scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>The design of individual comments are dictated by the designer. Comments typically include</p>
<ul>
<li>name of the commenter</li>
<li>the contents of the comment</li>
<li>date and time of the comment</li>
<li>avatar (if enabled)</li>
<li>reply to this comment link (if enabled)</li>
<li>When commenters submit a comment, if the comment needs to be moderated by the admin the text &#8220;You comment is awaiting moderation&#8221; is displayed.</li>
</ul>
<h5>The comment form</h5>
<p>Users that aren&#8217;t logged in will see a comment form requesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>their name (required),</li>
<li>their email address (required),</li>
<li>their website (optional, the theme designer can remove this)</li>
<li>the comment (required)</li>
<li>a submit button</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user fails to fill in the form correctly, our framework displays error messages next to each field.</p>
<p>If the website owner has required users register before leaving a comment, in place of the comment form logged out users will see the text &#8220;You must be logged in to post a comment.&#8221; In our framework, we display a login form below this text.</p>
<p>Users that are logged in will see the text &#8220;Logged in as <a href="#">username</a>. <a href="#">Log out?</a>&#8221; and a form requesting the comment followed by a submit button.</p>
<h3>Not found pages</h3>
<p>If a search term returns no results or a visitor enters a URL incorrectly, a no results/file not found page will be displayed.</p>
<p>Anything can be displayed on this page, by default our framework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a one line explanation of what&#8217;s happened,</li>
<li>a search form,</li>
<li>a site map.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional items</h3>
<p>The theme designer may wish to add additional items &amp; content to their WordPress site. For the most part your imagination is the limit.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<ul class="updates">
<li>28 Sep, 2011 &#8211; added a:active as suggested by <a href="/2011/wordpress-theme-elements/#comment-2326">Edward Caissie</a> below</li>
<li>28 Sep, 2011 &#8211; change heading level details for posts, brain freeze.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who has attempted to navigate a web page using the keyboard, will have experienced sites that remove the default <code>a:focus</code> style without adding in a replacement.</p>
<p>The cause – but not the fault – lays with Eric Meyer&#8217;s original <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/"><abbr>CSS</abbr> reset</a>, subsequently included in the <abbr>YUI</abbr> <abbr>CSS</abbr> framework, among others.</p>
<p><span id="more-1236"></span>
<p>Eric warned that he didn&#8217;t &#8220;recommend that you just use this in its unaltered state&#8221; but people did so anyway. Including the code:</p>
<pre><code>:focus {
  outline: 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>The problem became so widespread that Eric has <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/60685012059688960">apologised for it</a>, even though <strong>it wasn&#8217;t his fault people ignored his advice!</strong> In the second version of his reset, he removed the code above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At <a href="http://soupgiant.com/">Soupgiant</a>, we take a two-fold approach to link focus styles. We leave the outline in place because users have come to expect it. To increase the contrast of focused links further, we reverse the foreground and background colours too.</p>
<pre><code>a:link, a:visited {
  color: #00f;
  background: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
a:focus {
  color: #fff;
  background: #00f;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover, a:active {
  color: #00f;
  background: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>While it seems we are doubling up on some code, it&#8217;s a necessary evil as multiple pseudo-classes can be applied to single a link at once (for example: <code>:hover</code> and <code>:focus</code>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the cost of a few extra bytes, we believe it adds significantly to the usability of our sites. For that reason, we&#8217;ve included it in <a href="http://www.minimumpage.com/">Minimum Page</a>: our reset-free, <abbr>CSS</abbr> starting point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We decided to release <a href="http://soupgiant.com">Soupgiant</a>&#8216;s <abbr>CSS</abbr> base to the world at large. You can find it at <a href="http://www.minimumpage.com">minimumpage.com</a>.</p>
<p>Minimum Page comes from a frustration with <abbr>CSS</abbr> resets and bases. Ripping down the styling only to rebuild many of the same styles is unnecessary, especially for defaults common to all browsers.</p>
<p>To encourage people to consider the code they insert in their site, the styles aren&#8217;t provided in a minimised form. Developers should edit the original base to make generic, site wide changes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exactly what we use to start all of our CSS at Soupgiant. We think it&#8217;s important to share.</p>
<ul class="download" style="width: 220px; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<li class="download" style="list-style: none;"><a style="display: block; color: #fff; background: #00813F; padding: 10px; text-align: center; border-radius: 5px;" href="http://www.minimumpage.com">Find out more</a></li>
<li class="github" style="display: inline-block; padding: 5px;"><a href="https://github.com/soupgiant/minimum-page">View on github</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <code>!important</code> declaration has really bad reputation, and deservedly so. As is often the way, this reputation results from abuse rather an inherent problem with the property itself. An example of its abuse might be:</p>
<pre><code>#nav {
  float: none !important;
  /* where did I float this? */
}
/* ...jumble of code... */
ul#nav {
    float: left;
}</code></pre>
<p>There are, however, instances where the <code>!important</code> declaration is the best tool for the job.</p>
<p><span id="more-1110"></span></p>
<h3>Responsive Web</h3>
<p>The increase of users accessing web sites via mobile devices has redefined the way many design for the web. Rather than considering the desktop first, they now consider the mobile user. Andy Clarke&#8217;s <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/">320 and Up</a> is one reaction to this.</p>
<p>A requirement of the responsive web is that images expand and contract according to the width of the browser. To achieve this, the advice to define the width and height in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> has been reversed, an image should now be added without these attributes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="img.png" <del>width="30" height="30"</del> /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This leads to problems when redesigning a site, images in previous blog posts and older content could have the width and height defined. If the site uses a <abbr>CMS</abbr> with a visual editor, it may add the dimension to an image by default and content editors may unwittingly break the layout by leaving them in place.</p>
<p>To allow for this, I usually add the following to the <abbr>CSS</abbr></p>
<pre><code>img {
  height: auto !important;
  max-width: 100% !important;
}</code></pre>
<h3>Print Styles</h3>
<p>There are certain elements that are almost always hidden from print styles: skip links, navigation, and oversized footers, for example. Backgrounds are also removed as they&#8217;re not printed by default. Changes to the screen layout won&#8217;t alter these needs. To avoid future problems, it is legitimate to include the following in your style sheet:</p>
<pre><code>@media print {
  #nav, #footer, .sidebar {
    display: none !important;
  }
  .has-a-background {
    background: #fff !important;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="/2011/css-important-is-important/#comments">Leave a comment</a> with your thoughts if you frequently use <code>!important</code> for other purposes, agree or disagree.</p>
<p><strong>Update 16 Nov, 2011:</strong> changed <code>img</code> code block. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[I found it difficult to use pure and semantic <abbr>HTML5</abbr> when dealing with current versions of Internet Explorer. I really tried to adopt the commonly advocated view that it's okay to require website visitors have JavaScript enabled but settled on a different option I could actually live with.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of my career as a web developer I&#8217;ve produced websites that work without JavaScript. For the JavaScript impaired the sites may be missing a minor visual feature or be a little clunky in places, but they work and the meaning remains clear. It doesn&#8217;t bother me that, sometimes, the cost of allowing for sites to load without JavaScript can mean missing out on the latest web fashion. I&#8217;m <a title="Why I will not be dropping support for IE6" href="/behind-the-websites/not-dropping-ie6/">not a big fan of fashion</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, web development is undergoing some major transitions: the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> spec is being developed and <abbr>CSS3</abbr> is being implemented. The browser wars have returned, although this time around, it&#8217;s a battle to win developers&#8217; hearts by implementing the newest standards.</p>
<p>Now is the time for developers to re-evaluate their past practices; moving on from the old and embracing the new. I kept that ethos in mind when upgrading the Soupgiant WordPress base theme recently. Among other things we were porting it to <abbr>HTML5</abbr>.</p>
<p><span id="more-967"></span></p>
<p>I really tried to adopt the commonly advocated view that it&#8217;s okay to require website visitors have JavaScript enabled. It was going very well, right up to the final hurdle when I couldn&#8217;t resist checking the site I was working on without JavaScript.</p>
<p>Everything looked fine in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. It was, predictably, Internet Explorer that threw a spanner in the works. For an artist&#8217;s impression, <a href="http://code.bigredtin.com/html5/">visit the demo in <abbr>IE8</abbr></a> (<a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101213_2W1A/1/screen_shot/">screenshot</a> via WebPageTest):</p>
<div id="attachment_970" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101213_2W1A/1/screen_shot/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-970 " title="HTML5 as seen in IE8" src="/files/2010/12/ie8html5-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">HTML5 as seen in IE8</p></div>
<p>Without <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">Remy Sharp&#8217;s <abbr>HTML5</abbr> enabling script</a> the site I was working on was unusable, if anything, it looked worse than the demo provided.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t, in good faith, sell a website to a client that some visitors would find unstyled, half styled or difficult to follow in places. I didn&#8217;t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, the additional meaning provided by <abbr>HTML5</abbr> elements is just too great. <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc all provide meaning to a document that it&#8217;s difficult to justify going without.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s with the additional meaning in mind that I decided to go with &#8211; what I&#8217;ve dubbed &#8211; <abbr>HTML4.5</abbr>. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> provides the meaning while using traditional <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 tags as hooks for styling. It introduces a bit of tag soup, as instead of <code>&lt;article id="content"&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;</code> the code becomes <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;article&gt; ... &lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The improvement to site I was working on was immediate, as you can see by <a href="http://code.bigredtin.com/html5/html45.html">visiting the <abbr>html4.5</abbr> demo in IE8</a> (<a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101213_2W1B/1/screen_shot/">screenshot</a> via WebPageTest):</p>
<div id="attachment_973" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/101213_2W1B/1/screen_shot/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-973" title="HTML4.5 as seen in IE8" src="/files/2010/12/html45-300x174.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">HTML4.5 as seen in IE8</p></div>
<h4>I don&#8217;t care about tag soup</h4>
<p>If given the choice between an unusable website for some visitors or a little tag bloat, I&#8217;ll take the bloat any day of the week. In the demo the bloat adds an extra 14 bytes. On the home page for the site I was working on, it&#8217;s 40 bytes. I save plenty more than 40 bytes by minimising my JavaScript and <abbr>CSS</abbr> (a single key combo with the <a href="http://www.experienceinternet.co.uk/software/yui-compressor-textmate-bundle/">YUI Compressor TextMate bundle</a>), so I&#8217;m not too concerned about the side effects.</p>
<p>A technically beautiful site is the ideal but if a portion of your visitors can&#8217;t use it, then the beauty isn&#8217;t even skin deep. As <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">Drew McLellan</a> said recently on <a href="http://24ways.org/2010/finding-your-way-with-static-maps">24 ways</a>, progressive enhancement is &#8220;also known as doing our jobs properly.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I have often seen HTML forms coded as part of a lists, including from some publications and people I highly respect. I believe this to be incorrect.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Respecting someone or their publication does not prevent one from disagreeing with them. In fact, I think to nod along saying &#8220;you&#8217;re so right, <em>OMG, you are so right!</em>&#8221; is less respectful than listening to and considering what they say. That dealt with, allow me to disagree with some people I respect.</p>
<p>Frequently, I see HTML forms coded as lists. I&#8217;ve seen this in code by some publications and people I highly respect, such as on <a title="A List Apart: Forward thinking form validation" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/forward-thinking-form-validation/">A List Apart</a>. The code may be:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form action="example.php" method="post"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for="itemOne"&gt;Item One&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="itemOne" name="itemOne" /&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for="itemTwo"&gt;Item Two&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="itemTwo" name="itemTwo" /&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
<p><span id="more-908"></span></p>
<p>The method remains much the same if using unordered or definition lists. The argument for using this method is that forms are a list of fields. A variation is to use a table, arguing that forms are a table of labels and inputs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe either argument is correct, I believe forms are a series of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fieldset</code>s;</li>
<li><code>legend</code>s;</li>
<li><code>label</code>s;</li>
<li><code>button</code>s;</li>
<li><code>input</code>s, <code>select</code>s, <code>option</code>s, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All semantic meaning for forms should come from the appropriate <abbr>HTML</abbr> tags. If you want to use other elements as hooks for styling, they should be semantically meaningless <code>span</code>s and <code>div</code>s.</p>
<p>I consider the arguments cited above as justifications for making styling easier. Without block elements, forms <em>can</em> be difficult to style. Rather than wrapping each input pair with a list item, I wrap them with <code>div</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form action="example.php" method="post"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;label for="itemOne"&gt;Item One&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="itemOne" name="itemOne" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Wrapping each input pair in a <code>div</code> is just as lazy as wrapping each input pair in a list item. However, as <code>div</code>s are meaningless, it doesn&#8217;t require bending of semantics to justify my actions.</p>
<p>There is a valid argument for an element to define an input pair but I think such an element is redundant. We already have a method for defining the pairing of labels with their inputs. The &#8220;<code>for</code>&#8221; attribute within the <code>label</code> pairs with the &#8220;<code>id</code>&#8221; attribute of the associated <code>input</code>.</p>
<p>If you wrap your forms in a list or a table, look carefully at what you are doing. Ask yourself; is what you are doing semantically valid or are you lazily trying to make styling easier? As context for your consideration, ask yourself if a whole page of text is really just a list of paragraphs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updating the <a title="Soupgiant" href="http://soupgiant.com">Soupgiant</a> base WordPress theme recently (among other things we were porting it to <abbr>HTML5</abbr>), we needed to decide which <a title="shims and/or polyfills" href="http://remysharp.com/what-is-a-polyfill/">shims and/or polyfills</a> to use. We starterd with  <a title="on Remy Sharp's blog" href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">Remy Sharp&#8217;s HTML5 enabling script</a> but another to consider was <a title="Selectivizr" href="http://selectivizr.com/">Selectivizr</a> to improve <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>&#8216;s support of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, Version 3">CSS3</abbr> selectors.</p>
<p>One of the disadvantages of using Selectivizr is it rules out using a <abbr title="content distribution network ">CDN</abbr> for one&#8217;s style sheets. To quote their site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Style sheets MUST be hosted on the same domain as the page due to browser security restrictions. Likewise,  style sheets loaded using the <code>file:</code> protocol will not work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Normally, particularly for low traffic sites, this wouldn&#8217;t be of great concern. As we share style sheets across sites (both Big Red Tin &amp; <a title="our Business site" href="http://soupgiant.com/">Soupgiant</a> use the same <abbr>CSS</abbr>) and use the <abbr>CDN</abbr> feature of <a title="the WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> on our hosted WordPress sites, it could cause problems down the track.</p>
<p>After umming and ahhing for a couple of days, the following solution involving <a title="defined on 'quircksmode'" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">conditional comments</a>, occurred to us:</p>
<pre>&lt;!--[if gte IE 9]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.example.com/styles.css" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;

&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;</pre>
<p>With a few lines of conditional comments, browsers supporting the relevant selectors natively can take advantage of the performance boost from a <abbr>CDN</abbr> while developers can take advantage of the advanced selector support provided by Selectivizr for IE&lt;9 users.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve set up a quick <a title="demonstration" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/selectivizr/">demonstration</a> in which three paragraphs have different <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> roles &#8211; featured, unfeatured and neverfeatured &#8211; different styles are applied to each paragraph using [role=something]. The demo renders fully in: IE 6-9beta, Firefox (Win &amp; Mac), Chrome (Mac), Safari (Mac), and Opera (Mac).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Spritebaker" href="http://www.spritebaker.com/">Spritebaker</a> has been doing the rounds a fair bit in web development circles over the past few weeks, for the simple reason that it&#8217;s a great idea, done well. The best desciption comes from the site itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>It parses your css and returns a copy with all external media “baked” right into it as Base64 encoded datasets. The number of time consuming http-requests on your website is decreased significantly, resulting in a massive speed-boost.</p></blockquote>
<p>While baking images into your CSS to lower HTTP requests reduces the rendering time of your site overall, the downside is that CSS files <a title="block the initial rendering" href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/rendering.html#PutCSSInHead">block the initial rendering</a> of your site. While an unbaked site may render and be built up as external images load, a baked site will not render until both the CSS and baked images have loaded. This has the strange effect of making it seem like the page is actually taking <em>longer</em> to load.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thrown together a quick example of an <a title="unbaked page" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/unbaked.html">unbaked page</a> and its <a title="baked equivalent" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/baked.html">baked equivalent</a>. In this example, the unbaked page begins rendering earlier than its baked counterpart but finishes later.</p>
<p>In an attempt to kick off rendering earlier, I tried what I&#8217;ve named a half-baked idea: splitting the <em>standard</em> CSS into one file and the baked images into another. My hope was that browsers would render the standard CSS while the other was still loading. As you can see on the <a title="example page" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/halfbaked.html">example page</a>,  this failed.</p>
<p>With CSS only solutions delaying rendering of the page, it&#8217;s time to pull JavaScript out of our toolbox. Anyone whose read my article on <a title="delaying loading of print CSS" href="/behind-the-websites/delay-loading-of-print-css/">delaying loading of print CSS</a> will find the solution eerily familiar. The CSS files are still split into the standard files and the file containing the baked-in images, the one with the baked in images is wrapped in &lt;noscript&gt; tags in the HTML head.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="halfbaked-1.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="jshalfbaked-2.css" type="text/css" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This prevents the second/baked stylesheet from loading during the initial rendering of the page. Without this file blocking rendering, <a title="this version of the example" href="http://code.bigredtin.com/spritebaker/jsbaked.html">this version of the example</a> begins rendering as quickly as the first, unbaked, example.</p>
<p>The second/baked stylesheet needs to be added using the JavaScript below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
window.onload = function(){
  var cssNode = document.createElement('link');
  cssNode.type = 'text/css';
  cssNode.rel = 'stylesheet';
  cssNode.href = 'jshalfbaked-2.css';
  cssNode.media = 'all';
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(cssNode);
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Using the method above for baking images into your CSS will give you the best of both worlds, your page will render quickly with a basic structure before a single HTTP request is used to load all of your images.</p>
<p>I used <a title="Web Page Test" href="http://www.webpagetest.org">Web Page Test</a> to measure the first-run load times using IE9 Beta, averaged over 10 tests. On the test pages, with only a few images, the advantage of a baked stylesheet isn&#8217;t apparent, on a site with more images it would quickly become so.</p>

</table>
<p>As the <a title="Spritebaker Info page" href="http://www.spritebaker.com/info">Spritebaker info page</a> says, IE versions prior to IE8 don&#8217;t understand data-URIs, so you&#8217;ll need to use a generous sprinkling of conditional comments to load images the old fashioned way in these browsers.</p>
<p>The examples above were tested on IE9 Beta, Chrome 6.0, Safari 5.0, Opera 10.10 and Firefox 3.6.9. Individual results may vary.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to hear of your experiences with baking stylesheets, or other techniques you use to speed up apparent rendering of your page, especially if it slows the total load/rendering time.</p>

I had problems with this seemingly minor difference.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early 2009, I wrote a post on <a title="browser caching times" href="/behind-the-websites/caching-on-the-google-ajax-libraries-api/">browser caching times</a> for the Google AJAX Libraries API.</p>
<p>The cheat notes are that three different URLs point to the current edition of jQuery and each URL is cached in the browser for a different length of time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Latest in the version 1 tree" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js">Latest in the version 1 tree</a>: 1 hour</li>
<li><a title="Latest in the version 1.4 tree" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js">Latest in the version 1.4 tree</a>: 1 hour</li>
<li><a title="Version 1.4.2 exactly" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js">Version 1.4.2 exactly</a>: <strong>1 year</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The point of my post was that, when using Google&#8217;s AJAX Library to host jQuery, or any of the other libraries, it is best to specify the exact version to receive the full benefit of hosting on the same server as gazillions of other web sites, that being, your <a title="visitors don't need to download the library for every site they visit" href="http://encosia.com/2008/12/10/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/">visitors don&#8217;t need to download the library for every site they visit</a>. I was reminded of this when Dave Ward appeared on <a title="episode 32 of the official jQuery podcast" href="http://podcast.jquery.com/2010/08/27/episode-32-dave-ward/">episode 32 of the official jQuery podcast</a>.</p>
<p><a title="When jQuery 1.4 was released" href="http://jquery14.com/day-01/jquery-14">When jQuery 1.4 was released</a>, the Google URL being publicised by the jQuery team was <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js">http://&#8230;/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js</a> &#8211; while Google had set it up as <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.0/jquery.min.js">http://&#8230;/jquery/1.4.0/jquery.min.js</a>. I had two problems with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The publicised URL, coming from the official jQuery team, was only cached for 1 hour;</li>
<li>Anyone using the publicised URL would automatically be upgraded to jQuery 1.4.1 upon its release, regardless of their expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My request to John Resig and the jQuery team is to avoid confusion by officially numbering the next version as jQuery 1.5.0 and publicising the URL that contains the full version number.</strong></p>
<p>That means that for most people the default version of jQuery they download will be updated least often. It means that the people building the websites have more control over which version of jQuery their end users download and when.</p>
<p>It may seem trivial now but if your visitors leave your site while they&#8217;re waiting for jQuery to download, you&#8217;ll think it less so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below or via <a title="@bigredtin" href="http://twitter.com/?status=@bigredtin">@bigredtin</a> on Twitter. If you agree, why not let the jQuery team know <a title="via Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/?status=@jquery">via Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the blog post announcing version 1.5, the jQuery team did publicise the 1.5.0 URL on the Google CDN.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We haven&#8217;t yet moved onto HTML5 at Soupgiant. We still code in strict XHTML 1.0 for reasons that <a href="/author/peter/" title="Peter Wilson  |  Big Red Tin">Peter</a> knows a lot better than I, but I suspect it has something to do with familiarity and knowing that it works. There&#8217;s a safety in that.</p>
<p>We believe very strongly in semantic mark-up and getting things working as much as possible in as many places. We believe in graceful degradation. I believe in closing tags once they&#8217;re opened and I didn&#8217;t like how HTML5 didn&#8217;t demand a trailing slash on stand alone elements. That just seemed like chaos.</p>
<p><a href="http://adactio.com/" title="Adactio: Jeremy Keith">Jeremy Keith</a>&#8216;s new book, <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> is a no-nonsense 85 pages of the good and bad in the HTML5 specification. It explains how the spec is a lot more open and forgiving than previous specs. It also explains how much work was done to ensure better semantics than previous versions of HTML.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably thinking exactly what I was. How can any 85 page book tell me what I need to know about the largest HTML specification thus far? Is 85 pages even a book or is it more like an extended pamphlet? How can I take this seriously?</p>
<p>We bought the book largely because we trust the work <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman Presents The Daily Report">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> does. This is the first book he has published under Happy Cog&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.happycog.com/publish/abookapart/" title="A Book Apart: Happy Cog">A Book Apart</a> label. I thought that if anybody can get a writer to condense all the info I need into a short read, it&#8217;s Zeldman. But no pressure, JZ.</p>
<p>The important things it explains is how HTML5 can be used to include rich media on your websites, how it improves web forms (which got me really excited) and how it improves on semantics. And yes, it does actually explain them.</p>
<p>It explains these topics in enough detail that I could start using them today.</p>
<p>I want to keep learning and improving my knowledge of web-based coding. At the same time, <a href="http://soupgiant.com/" title="Soupgiant | Web Production">I&#8217;m running a business now</a> as well as continuing to produce <a href="http://boxcutters.net/" title="Boxcutters - Australian Television Podcast">a weekly podcast</a> and trying to have a life. It&#8217;s hard to keep up with all the details of a new spec.</p>
<p>It turns out, all I ever wanted was an 85 page book that explained everything I needed to know and cut out all the stuff I&#8217;ll never use. I don&#8217;t need a beginner&#8217;s book but I also don&#8217;t want an expert&#8217;s tome. I want an executive summary and that&#8217;s exactly what this book is. If that&#8217;s all you need, look no further.</p>
