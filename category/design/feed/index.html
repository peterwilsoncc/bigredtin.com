				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple are known for their beautiful design and their &ldquo;it just works&rdquo; mentality. It&rsquo;s one of the things I love about my own Apple products. My parents, on the other hand, are known for not being me.</p>
<p>The only computers my parents have ever used are Windows machines. They call viruses &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;. My father still complains about the purchase of a seemingly unnecessary maths co-processor in 1990. My mother writes down all the instructions I give her and follows them one by one. These are not people to whom computer technology naturally presents itself as being in any way obvious to use.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that my parents both have English as a third language and the need for clear and obvious instructions or steps is even more understandable.</p>
<p>So it was important to me to see how they attacked the problem of setting up a new iPad armed with only the box it came in. I filmed them as they went through the process trying as much as possible to be an independent observer. I wanted to uncover answers to two main questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the things we consider to be user-friendly really that obvious?</li>
<li>What are the barriers to entry for someone who wants to use technology but regards it with suspicion?</li>
</ol>
<p>They opened the iPad box to reveal the following 5 separate pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>the iPad itself</li>
<li>a USB cord</li>
<li>a power supply</li>
<li>an Australian power plug adaptor</li>
<li>an envelope which itself features:
<ul>
<li>a pin clipped to the outside</li>
<li>a card with a picture of an ipad on one side</li>
<li>warranty information</li>
<li>apple stickers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That was it. No instructions that they could see.</p>
<p>They shuffled through all of the documentation in the envelope and couldn&rsquo;t find any instructions. There are instructions on the back of the card with the iPad on one side but it took a while to notice them.</p>
<p>In all <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ipod+2+unboxing&amp;aq=0s&amp;oq=ipad+2+unb">the &ldquo;unboxing&rdquo; videos</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=ipad%202%20unboxing">photo collections</a> I&rsquo;ve seen, nobody ever looks at the back of that card.</p>
<p>The first instruction is to download iTunes.</p>
<p>Dad didn&rsquo;t want iTunes. He wanted to use his iPad. He had no intention of using it to play music.</p>
<p>For someone suspicious of technology this is enough of a barrier. There is no explanation of iTunes being the software that will prime the iPad. iTunes is a music player.</p>
<p>All my parents needed was a preceding line that said &ldquo;You will need iTunes to set up your iPad&rdquo; and their suspicion would have been subdued. The assumption Apple made, however, is that people will follow instructions without explanation.</p>
<p>When building websites we often assume that what we have designed is obvious. It might be obvious to someone who has used similar things before but what about someone who has never used it before?</p>
<p>We deal with usability every day. We hope that the things we create work for everybody who uses them. In the box for iPad 2, Apple provides the instruction for what to do next but not why it should be done. People should be suspicious when a corporation, website or person tries to force trust and faith.</p>
<p>There are other moments in the set up when this happens. It happens with accepting the iTunes EULA. Apple pretends to offer a choice but it&rsquo;s really just dictation. Accept or don&rsquo;t use the $900 device you just purchased. That&rsquo;s the choice.</p>
<p>Of course, this sounds a lot more sinister than it probably is but it&rsquo;s so easy for bad instruction to feel like being ordered rather than guided. That is something we need to keep in mind when designing for usability. Sometimes there is no choice but if we are given reason then lack of choice is so much easier to swallow.<span id="more-1077"></span><br />
<h3>Update: 9 June 2011</h3>
<p>Apple are trying to improve this experience with a no-computer no-itunes set-up process with the impending release of iOS 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/ios-5-beta-1-for-ipad-hands-on/#4198773">Engaget has screenshots</a> of what the process will look like. Turn it on and get a set-up screen. Now that&#8217;s more like it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The details are important.</p>
<p>Recently I saw a <a href="http://www.ted.com" title="TED - Ideas Worth Spreading">TED Talk</a> (embedded after the jump) by <a href="http://community.brandrepublic.com/blogs/rory_sutherlands_blog/default.aspx" title="Rory Sutherland's Blog">Rory Sutherland</a>, Vice Chairman for the Ogilvy Group in the UK. In it he describes how it&#8217;s the small things that really make all the difference. These small things are the details.</p>
<p><img src="/files/2011/01/Jetstar-Seat-Checker-1-400w.png" alt="Jetstar Seat Chooser page" border="0" width="400" height="317" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;" title="Jetstar seat chooser as it currently appears" /><br />
A friend just booked a ticket on <a href="http://www.jetstar.com/au/en/index.aspx" title="Cheap flights - Jetstar Airways">Jetstar</a> while I watched (these are the things I do on my holidays). Jetstar&#8217;s ticketing system is pretty simple and straight-forward until you get to the seat choice page.</p>
<p>This is where confusion occurred. She clicked around for a bit but, very simply, just did not know what to do. The page confused her.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re also confused, the squares with the stars, circles and crosses are seats. Some of those are seats that are already reserved (red with crosses), some cost extra because of their premium positions (up front or extra leg room). The squares with light grey and dark grey inside them are available.</p>
<p>Mostly the problems related to the tabs at the top of the seat chooser. See that the &#8220;Flight Back&#8221; tab is a dark grey and so are the headings on the sidebar areas on the left? This is a confusion of the visual grammar of the site (highlighted in the next image).</p>
<p><img src="/files/2011/01/Jetstar-Seat-Checker-1-headingColour.png" alt="Jetstar seat chooser with visual grammar highlighted" border="0" width="389" height="175" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;" title="Jetstar seat chooser with visual grammar highlighted" /><br />
In this context, a dark grey background means &#8220;heading&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible to make this even more specific and uniform and say that a dark grey heading background with capitalised, italicised and white text means &#8220;heading&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because of this initial confusion, something else I hadn&#8217;t expected happened. The visual grammar prompted her to imagine a separation line extending down from the edge of the tabs. The way she initially read the page, the left half of the little boxes were for seats on the flight out and the right-hand-side were for seats on the way home. Because three little boxes did not correlate with her knowledge of aeroplane seating, she was at a complete loss of what to do.</p>
<p>The tasks she expected to be able to perform on this page and the information she received from the page were at odds with each other and a kind of user paralysis settled on her mouse hand. I&#8217;ve seen this user paralysis before. The user eventually gets over it and figures out what the page is asking of them or they give up and shop elsewhere. Either way, they think less of the website and the company as a result of their negative experience.</p>
<p>The very same thing happened to me when using <a href="http://www.myki.com.au/" title="myki - it's your key">the Myki website</a> for the first time to purchase my card. I only persevered out of professional interest for how to make a poor user experience. If I was anybody else I would just continue to buy my public transport tickets at the local milk bar.</p>
<p>A lack of attention to detail causes user paralysis. Very few website producers manage to create a website without something that could lead to this, but it happens most often in forms. It&#8217;s one of the reasons that user testing is so important. It&#8217;s also a good reason to have some budget up your sleeve to make a whole bunch of tiny changes about 6 months after the website launches.</p>
<p>When we&#8217;re building websites we try to preempt what a user will experience. If we skip steps in designing these experiences, or rush, or miscommunicate some ideas, we are in danger of spoiling the user&#8217;s opinion of the company, our client.</p>
<p>We ask a lot of questions of our clients because the way their customers use their websites will be a vital part of their business. Sometimes this means finding out a lot about how the business works. Sometimes it means asking questions that the client thinks irrelevant or has never really thought about before. It&#8217;s hard work for all involved but it&#8217;s exactly through this process that we get to identify a lot of the details we need to include in the website.</p>
<p>Some tiny details are all that the Jetstar seat checker required to make it more obvious on how to proceed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the active tab consistent with the heading styles;</li>
<li>Create some lines of demarkation between the tabs to make their seperation more obvious;</li>
<li>Identify the windows and aisles of the aeroplane;</li>
<li>Declare the type of aeroplane to give a better idea of what the user is looking at.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ve created my own version of this in the image below. I am, by no means, a graphic designer, so please excuse the sloppy work. The point, however, is that it wouldn&#8217;t take very much work to fix this, but it&#8217;s also really easy to see how something this small could be missed the first time around.<br />
<img src="/files/2011/01/Jetstar-Seat-Checker-1-fixed.png" alt="Jetstar seat chooser with some extra details" border="0" width="650" height="515" title="Jetstar seat chooser with some extra details" /></p>
<p>My friend would have worked out the page within about 30 seconds but she shouldn&#8217;t have had to work at all. All the work should have been done for her beforehand. Our job is to make website interaction as obvious as possible. Doing that takes a lot of attention to detail.<span id="more-1026"></span></p>
<p>And now, enjoy learning a little bit more about details from Rory Sutherland:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a theory of Japanese car construction called <a href="http://thequalityportal.com/pokayoke.htm" title="Poka Yoke or Mistake Proofing :: Overview :: The Quality Portal">poka yoke</a>. It was described to me as meaning a form of idiot-proofing but it really means &#8220;mistake proofing&#8221;. Pieces of the car are manufactured in such a way that they can only be used on one particular part of the car.</p>
<p>Everything that we create when producing websites should exist on this level of poka yoke design. The goal in user interface design is to remove all ambiguity so that each part of the website can only be used in one particular way.</p>
<p>This is a lot more difficult than it seems. Take, for example, the simple hyperlink. So often, when analysing an existing website I see the words &#8220;click here&#8221; either preceding or following an instruction.</p>
<p><img src="/files/2010/11/CD6297F2-3E84-439B-AEF8-3ABD3890AE2A.jpg" alt="CD6297F2-3E84-439B-AEF8-3ABD3890AE2A.jpg" border="0" width="202" height="227" align="left" alt="Peerless Foods website with buttons that says 'view'" />In the case of the <a href="http://www.peerlessfoods.com.au/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=50" title="Peerless Foods :: Copha Vegetable Shortening">Peerless Foods website</a>, which I was shown on the weekend, there&#8217;s simply the word &#8220;view&#8221; near some text. (See the image to the left.)</p>
<p>To some it might seem like &#8220;click here&#8221; or &#8220;view&#8221; is the perfect example of poka yoke. It&#8217;s a link and we&#8217;re supposed to click on it and that&#8217;s what it says. But the design* has failed.</p>
<p>Creating a website design requires making as few assumptions about the user as possible. One of those assumptions might be that the user knows how to use a mouse. That might seem like a reasonable assumption but what about people who use other interactive devices? What about just keyboard or suck and blow straws or touch screens.</p>
<p>So the minimal assumption has to be that the user realises that there is an interactive device that they can manipulate in a way that will be reflected on the feedback device (screen or screen reader etc., from now on just referred to as &#8220;screen&#8221;).</p>
<p>So the user moves the cursor around the screen. It&#8217;s the feedback that we provide as designers that tells the user to activate that link. Sometimes that&#8217;s as simple as a different colour text with an underline. Sometimes that&#8217;s a hover state that alters the size of an element. Maybe the cursor changes from an arrow to a hand. Maybe it&#8217;s just as simple as making sure that the right html tags were used.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a usability adage that <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/the-evolution-of-door-usability/" title="The Evolution of Door Usability | UX Booth">if there needs to be a sign on the door that says &#8220;push&#8221;, the designer of the door has failed</a>. That fact that the door needs to be pushed to open should be implicit in its design.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting to put a &#8220;click here&#8221; at the end of a sentence because it&#8217;s the easiest thing for the content creator to do but it complicates issues for the user of the website. It&#8217;s clumsy and it reflects poorly on everybody involved in creating the website.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it&#8217;s not mistake proof. On the Peerless Foods website, those little green buttons don&#8217;t give the user any extra information. In fact, it&#8217;s not clear that they are even related to the information above them.</p>
<p>A bit of text that says &#8220;if you want to contact us, <a href="http://soupgiant.com/contact/" title="Contact  |  Soupgiant">click here</a>&#8221; is nowhere near as succinct and obvious as one that just says &#8220;<a href="http://soupgiant.com/contact/" title="Contact  |  Soupgiant">contact us</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>For more reading on website usability, we recommend <a href="http://www.useit.com/" title="useit.com: Jakob Nielsen on Usability and Web Design">the writings of Jakob Neilson</a>, and Steve Krug&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789723107?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=boxcutters-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0789723107">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think!</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=boxcutters-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0789723107" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. There&#8217;s also a great <a href="http://example.com/">book about the usability and design of doors and kettles</a> by Donald A. Norman.</p>
<p>*when I talk about design I include content because it&#8217;s an important part of how people interact with a site. I also include the choice of HTML tags.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Real world experience counts for a lot when developing for an online world. Sure, it sounds trite but it's frighteningly true. Working on redesigning the user interface for an online store, I found myself digging deep into my own experiences to be able to anticipate the needs of the customer.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working on redesigning the user interface for an online store, I found myself digging deep into my own experiences to be able to anticipate the needs of the customer.</p>
<p>For 8 years, from the ages of 14 to 22, I worked in retail. My parents ran a couple of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manchester">manchester</a> stores and I worked there after school and on weekends. In two of those years I also worked in a video library*.</p>
<p>The thing about designing for the web is, we often don&#8217;t take into account, not only what our audience&#8217;s real-world experience is, but also our own.</p>
<p>When laying out a &#8216;brick &amp; mortar&#8217; retail store, there is a logical flow to entice customers further in. A clothing retailer, for example, has the changing rooms at the back of the store so you have to walk past all the racks first. Trestle tables with specials are outside the store to entice the customer to come in.</p>
<p>&#8216;Brick &#038; mortar&#8217; stores have their differences to online stores but customers expect a similar experience. The shopping brain has certain established neural pathways. It&#8217;s easier to capitalise on those than to try to forge new pathways.</p>
<p>When I explained the concept of the customer&#8217;s journey through the store to my client I could speak with experienced knowledge of how a customer expects to be treated.</p>
<p>I was able to draw on my knowledge and experience in working with shoppers to design and explain how an online shop needs to feel. I used parts of the screen real-estate as if they were parts of the shop floor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shopping cart is like the cashier&#8217;s counter. It needs to be visible, obvious but unobtrusive to the flow of the store. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s in the top right, squarish and about one third the width of the content area.</li>
<li>The front page is like the window-dressing. It needs to show popular, attractive, sought-after, and new items in an enticing way. It&#8217;s a lot easier in a web-store because you can actually give areas of the screen titles like &#8220;Popular Items&#8221;, &#8220;Highest Rated&#8221; and &#8220;Recently Added&#8221;. Cookies and user history also give the opportunity to tailor the store to the visitor.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a section of the front page that has a different coloured header and displays some heavily discounted items like the trestle tables on the footpath in front of the shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of times when I&#8217;ve worked on websites in areas of business where I didn&#8217;t have 8 years&#8217; experience. In those situations I&#8217;ve sat down with clients and asked them to show me every aspect of their business I can think of. I go through business processes with them for hours so that I can accurately recreate real world experiences. </p>
<p>We have a tendency, because we work with computers, to isolate ourselves from the real world. We forget, sometimes, that people in the real world often just want to replicate their own experience with some added convenience. It&#8217;s up to us to be able to capture the essence of the real world to make our audiences feel more comfortable online. Sometimes that means digging into our own past and sometimes it means distilling someone else&#8217;s knowledge but the aim should always remain: Make the user&#8217;s transition from real world to online as seamless as possible.</p>
<p><em>*The older people in the audience may need to explain that concept to the young &#8216;uns.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=boxcutters-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Amazon Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=boxcutters-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B0015T963C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> came into my life.</p>
<p>To test it out I obtained a free copy of <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=UFhlhCvQigkC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=hound+of+the+baskervilles&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=6BDrd2XvtZ&#038;sig=7gnwjXpUalRLTHxlTqvMbzKZV7w&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=aXkyTI2sO463cbHI2bgD&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=3&#038;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a> from the online store and started reading. I was an instant convert. I loved the experience and I loved the concept.</p>
<p>Until, that is , I found my way into Chapter 2 and there were vital passages missing from the text. It soiled my experience with the Kindle.</p>
<p>There are a number of lessons here. Obviously, there&#8217;s the whole <em>caveat emptor</em>, you get what you pay for scenario. A little bit of research would have shown me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/RX146XZB1IJWQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">this review</a> that tells me up-front what to expect:</p>
<blockquote><p> This edition is missing certain passages&#8230; Whenever there is a point in the story where a character reads out of a newspaper or other document, that passage is missing from this Kindle edition. Spend a dollar and get a different version. </p></blockquote>
<p>But the other lesson is more a question for thought. Why would Amazon keep the book in their store if it&#8217;s not what people are expecting? There is no obvious avenue to inform Amazon of the problem with the book and no way to ask them to remove the book so other people don&#8217;t fall into the same trap.</p>
<p>When building the user interface of an online store, there are many things to take into account. Feedback is vital for any business. Amazon and <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a> have built empires with great customer service but customer service is about a lot more than just an attentive complaints department or a good returns policy.</p>
<p>Great customer service starts with the user interface. It&#8217;s the experience a customer has when they browse or purchase a product. A bad UI is like having a rude salesperson on the shop floor. A customer should be able to trust that the seller is looking out for them. There should be a way to bring issues of faulty products to the attention of the sellers. </p>
<p>Sometimes there are use-cases that just aren&#8217;t foreseen. But when they reveal themselves it&#8217;s important for an online store to be able to adapt.</p>
<p>So there are things that Amazon could have implemented to make my experience better. A roll-over information box that showed me the start of the most helpful review, for example, could have given me the information I needed to make my decision to purchase or not.</p>
<p>These are the small design things; the small usability things that we try to develop every day.</p>
<p>Recently I designed some wireframes for an online store. It&#8217;s hard. I had to balance the client&#8217;s budget with the limited information I had, the inclusion and prioritisation of use-cases, and a degree of future-proofing to allow for unforeseen developments.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information to include in an online store. There are lots of buttons and lots of icons to demand a customer&#8217;s attention. It&#8217;s important to remember, however, that customers want something very simple: They want to buy stuff and for it to behave as expected. Give them that and the rest will follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brief for Big Red Tin and its redesigned sister site, <a title="Soupgiant" href="http://soupgiant.com">Soupgiant</a>, included a couple of notes for our very patient designer, <a title="Christa at Zepol" href="http://zepol.com.au">Christa at Zepol</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The frame of both sites will be pretty similar. We were thinking of different colour schemes [...] as a way of demarcating the two sites.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t got an exact style in mind, but something relaxed and modern without going over the top &#8211; <em>Web 1.5 if you like</em>.</p>
<p>— source: email to Zepol (emphasis added for this post)</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the brief detailed the <a title="content separation" href="/content-strategy/the-right-content-for-the-right-audience/">content separation</a> between Soupgiant and Big Red Tin. We wanted the design to come from the designer to fit the content, not from a committee to fit some other agenda.</p>
<p>In the context of this site&#8217;s design, the exact interpretation of Web 1.5 was left to Christa&#8217;s devices. As should the exact interpretation of any design brief.</p>
<p>To me, web 1.5 means something like: <strong>dump all the cliches of Web 2.0 design, at the same time keep the good bits</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A good bit&#8221; may be a feature that is used frequently, such as oversized footers, because it adds something for users of the site. Cliches are those design tricks that add nothing but appear on every second web site, such as elements with faded backgrounds and rounded corners.</p>
<p>It strikes me, as a developer, it must be said that the definition of design is something similar: <strong>dump all the cliches and keep all the good bits</strong></p>
<p>Failing to do so risks rendering you a regurgitator, not a designer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[To call oneself a 'Web Designer' is about as accurate and explanatory as saying 'I work with computers'.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_designer">long and annoyingly complicated article about web design</a>, which begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Web design is the skill of creating presentations of content (usually hypertext or hypermedia) that is delivered to an end-user through the World Wide Web, by way of a Web browser or other Web-enabled software like Internet television clients, microblogging clients and RSS readers.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, &#8216;creating presentations&#8217; you say. To call oneself a &#8216;Web Designer&#8217; is about as accurate as saying &#8216;I work with computers&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Saving files in HTML format is now a common feature in Office 2000 programs. In other words, you can save Word documents in HTML format and you can publish Excel workbooks as Web pages. <br /><em>&#8211; taken from <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA010548931033.aspx?pid=CH010485191033" title="Mircosoft Office 2000 Help">Opening and saving files in Office</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>For years now we&#8217;ve been able to export Microsoft Word documents as HTML files. By Wikipedia&#8217;s definition, everybody everywhere who has ever created a word document could be called a &#8216;Web Designer&#8217;.</p>
<p>This topic came up recently because we had the phrase &#8216;web designer&#8217;, or something like it, on our <a href="/about/">About</a> page. Meanwhile, on our portfolio page we had some, admittedly ambiguous, text about a specific piece of work we had done before Soupgiant was created.</p>
<p>This caused confusion. We received a demanding email from the graphic designers responsible for that work that we explain ourselves. Apparently their client saw our site and said &#8220;somebody&#8217;s taking credit for your design work&#8221;.</p>
<p>It took a little while before we worked out where the confusion. At no point did we intend to take credit for the design. As a matter of course we outsource all our graphic design because that is not our skill-set.</p>
<p>The common term is &#8216;Web Design&#8217;, but we don&#8217;t do design. Can we be &#8216;Web Engineers&#8217; without having an engineering degree? What about &#8216;Web Architects&#8217;?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve decided to go with the term &#8216;Web Production&#8217; because what we do is more akin to a Producer&#8217;s role than anything else. We coordinate the production of websites and content. We can create, or organise the creation of, audio and video for podcasts. We can code but we also work with information architecture, testing, usability, and accessibility.</p>
<p>We bring together all the things that go into making a website. We stay up-to-date on technologies to ensure our clients get the best product possible for their budget. We coordinate, we define, we build, we code, we acquire, we provide, but we do not design. At least, we don&#8217;t do it well. We hire graphic designers to do that because that&#8217;s <em>their</em> area of expertise.</p>
<p><em>Our</em> area of expertise is creating excellent, accessible and functional websites using every resource we have at our disposal.</p>
